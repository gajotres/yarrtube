## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Video Card Presentation
Video cards on the home view and on a category's view SHALL be drawn without a frame and without a background: the thumbnail and the text below it sit directly on the page background, with no border and no padding around the card. Hovering a card with a pointer SHALL show a soft background behind the whole card and slightly enlarge the thumbnail within its rounded bounds. Below the title, a card SHALL show a meta line:
- **Channel video:** the channel's avatar beside the title, and on the meta line the channel's name followed by " · " and how long ago the video was published.
- **Playlist video:** a placeholder playlist icon in the avatar's place, and on the meta line the playlist's name followed by " · " and how long ago the video was published.
- **No publish date:** the meta line shows only the source's name.

The relative date SHALL read as a short age ("3h ago", "2d ago", "5w ago", "4mo ago", "2y ago").

Activating a card anywhere SHALL open its video, except on the card's own controls: the channel's avatar and the playlist icon lead to the source's view, as does the source's name on the meta line, and the actions menu control opens the menu. Category chips are labels, not controls: activating one opens the video like the rest of the card. Each card SHALL offer a single link to its video, so keyboard users move through cards one stop per video plus the source and menu controls.

#### Scenario: Frameless card
- **WHEN** a user views the home view
- **THEN** no video card has a border, padding or background colour of its own

#### Scenario: Hovering a card
- **WHEN** a user hovers a video card with a pointer
- **THEN** a soft background appears behind the card and its thumbnail is slightly enlarged without overflowing its rounded corners

#### Scenario: Channel card meta line
- **WHEN** a home card shows a video of the channel "BettaTech" published 2 days ago
- **THEN** its meta line reads "BettaTech · 2d ago" and the channel's avatar is shown beside the title

#### Scenario: Playlist card meta line
- **WHEN** a home card shows a video of the playlist "Chess Middlegames" published 5 weeks ago
- **THEN** a playlist icon is shown beside the title and its meta line reads "Chess Middlegames · 5w ago"

#### Scenario: Unknown publish date
- **WHEN** a home card shows a channel video with no publish date
- **THEN** its meta line reads only the channel's name

#### Scenario: Activating the card's empty space
- **WHEN** a user clicks a card's padding or the empty end of its meta line
- **THEN** the application opens that card's video

#### Scenario: Activating the playlist icon
- **WHEN** a user activates the playlist icon on a card of the playlist "Chess Middlegames"
- **THEN** the application opens the "Chess Middlegames" view, not the video

### Requirement: Home Card Category Chips
On the home view's "Continue watching", "Quick watches" and "Latest videos" sections, each video card SHALL show the video's categories, in the order the video lists them, as small text chips below its meta line. Each chip SHALL show the category's name in a dark shade of the category's hue, over a soft tint of that hue. A card SHALL show at most 2 chips, followed by a "+N" chip when the video has more categories. A video in no category SHALL show no chip row. Cards in "More about <category>" sections and on a category's view SHALL NOT show chips.

#### Scenario: One category
- **WHEN** a video under "Latest videos" belongs to "Chess"
- **THEN** its card shows one chip reading "Chess", tinted with Chess's hue

#### Scenario: Many categories
- **WHEN** a video under "Continue watching" belongs to "AI & Code", "Chess" and "Science"
- **THEN** its card shows the chips "AI & Code", "Chess" and "+1"

#### Scenario: No category
- **WHEN** a video under "Quick watches" belongs to no category
- **THEN** its card shows no chip row

#### Scenario: Category sections show no chips
- **WHEN** a user views the "More about Chess" section or the "Chess" view
- **THEN** no card in it shows a category chip

### Requirement: Home Shelves
At or above the small breakpoint, "Continue watching", each category section and "Quick watches" SHALL each show their videos in a single row whose number of columns follows the width available to the content area, not the viewport. A section SHALL show only as many videos as fit in that row and SHALL never leave a partial second row. "Latest videos" SHALL keep a multi-row grid whose rows are always complete except possibly the last. Below the small breakpoint, those same sections SHALL be horizontal rows the user can swipe, each card about three quarters of the content width so that the next card peeks in, snapping card by card.

#### Scenario: Wide desktop
- **WHEN** a category section has 6 videos and the content area fits 5 columns
- **THEN** the section shows 5 videos in one row and no second row

#### Scenario: Collapsed sidebar or narrower content
- **WHEN** the content area narrows so that only 3 columns fit
- **THEN** each shelf section shows 3 videos in one row

#### Scenario: Swiping a shelf on a phone
- **WHEN** a user on a phone-width viewport views "Continue watching" with 4 videos
- **THEN** the section shows one card at about three quarters of the width with the next card peeking in, and swiping horizontally brings the next card into place

### Requirement: Mobile Latest Videos Feed
Below the small breakpoint, "Latest videos" SHALL be a single-column list of full-width cards, each with its full-width thumbnail and its title wrapping on up to 2 lines.

#### Scenario: Latest videos on a phone

#### Scenario: Tapping a card's menu on a phone
- **WHEN** a user on a touch device taps near a card's "⋮" control
- **THEN** the video actions menu opens, from a hit area at least 44 by 44 pixels

### Requirement: Loading Placeholders
While a view's videos are loading, the application SHALL show placeholders shaped like the content they stand for (thumbnail blocks with title and meta lines, or list rows), animated subtly, instead of "Loading…" text. The loading region SHALL be marked busy for assistive technology and SHALL be announced as loading. This applies to the home view, a category's view, and a channel's or playlist's video list. Placeholders SHALL take the space of the content they stand for, so the layout does not shift when the content arrives. When the motion-reduction preference is set, placeholders SHALL NOT animate.

#### Scenario: Home while loading
- **WHEN** a user opens the home view and its videos are still loading
- **THEN** the view shows placeholder sections of placeholder cards, marked busy, and no section heading such as "Latest videos"

#### Scenario: Home after loading
- **WHEN** the home view's videos arrive
- **THEN** the placeholders are replaced by the real sections and nothing is marked busy

#### Scenario: Channel video list while loading
- **WHEN** a user opens a channel's view and its videos are still loading
- **THEN** the video list shows placeholder rows, marked busy, instead of "Loading videos…"

### Requirement: Global Search
The header SHALL offer a search control named "Search" that opens a search dialog. The dialog SHALL also open with ⌘K on macOS and Ctrl+K elsewhere, from anywhere in the application except while another dialog is open. As the user types, the dialog SHALL show results grouped, in this order:
- **Categories**: names containing the text, ignoring case.
- **Channels**: names containing the text, ignoring case.
- **Playlists**: names containing the text, ignoring case.
- **Videos**: the matches the daemon returns for the text, as described in the `video-search` capability, each with its thumbnail, title and source name.

Name matches SHALL appear as the user types. Video results SHALL be requested only once the text has at least 2 characters and the user has paused typing briefly. A group with no matches SHALL be hidden. When no group has matches, the dialog SHALL say nothing matches the text. While videos are being searched, the Videos group SHALL show that it is searching. Results SHALL be navigable with the arrow keys and chosen with Enter or a click. Choosing a category, channel or playlist SHALL navigate to its view; choosing a video SHALL open it in its source's view. Choosing a result or pressing Escape SHALL close the dialog. On phone-width viewports the search control SHALL be an icon button in the header, and the dialog SHALL cover the screen.

#### Scenario: Opening with the keyboard
- **WHEN** a user presses ⌘K on macOS
- **THEN** the search dialog opens with its field focused

#### Scenario: Grouped matches
- **WHEN** a user types "chess" and the category "Chess", the channel "ChessCoach Andras" and videos titled "Chess Tactics: Spot the Trigger" exist

- **THEN** the dialog closes and the application opens that video in the "BettaTech" channel view

#### Scenario: Nothing matches
- **WHEN** a user types "zzz" and nothing matches
- **THEN** the dialog says nothing matches "zzz"

#### Scenario: Video search fails
- **WHEN** the video search request fails
- **THEN** the Videos group says videos could not be searched, and the name matches are still shown

### Requirement: Sidebar Count Style
The unwatched counts on sidebar rows and on folded section headings SHALL be shown as muted, small, tabular numerals at the row's trailing edge, without a filled background, and in the full foreground colour on the active row.

#### Scenario: Count on a channel row
- **WHEN** a channel row shows an unwatched count of 3
- **THEN** the count "3" is shown as a muted numeral without a filled pill behind it

### Requirement: Compact Mobile Announcement Bar
Below the small breakpoint, the announcement bar SHALL take a single line: the announcement's text truncated to one line, followed by its links, with the dismiss control at the trailing edge.

#### Scenario: Long announcement on a phone
- **WHEN** a user on a phone-width viewport sees an announcement whose text is longer than one line
- **THEN** the bar shows a single line with the text truncated, its links and the dismiss control

### Requirement: Video List Row Date

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Preferences View Width
The preferences view SHALL be aligned to the left edge of the content area, like the other views, at the same maximum width as the tasks view.

#### Scenario: Consistent width
- **WHEN** a user opens the tasks view and then the preferences view on a wide screen
- **THEN** both start at the left edge of the content area with the same maximum width

### Requirement: No Category UI While Categories Are Off
While `categories_enabled` is off, or the preferences are still loading, the application SHALL NOT show the sidebar Categories section, the Categories field in the add and edit channel and playlist dialogs, home category sections or home card category chips, and the header search SHALL NOT list a Categories group. When the preferences cannot be loaded, the application SHALL behave as with the defaults.

#### Scenario: Sidebar without categories

"Continue watching" SHALL display up to 6 videos the user has started and not finished recently. "Quick watches" SHALL display up to 6 short unwatched videos. Each category section SHALL display up to 6 videos, as described in "Home Category Sections". "Continue watching", the category sections and "Quick watches" SHALL be laid out as described in "Home Shelves"; "Latest videos" as a grid, and below the small breakpoint as described in "Mobile Latest Videos Feed". Cards SHALL be presented as described in "Video Card Presentation". "Latest videos" SHALL be hidden when it has no videos while another section has videos; when no section has videos, "Latest videos" SHALL be shown saying no videos have been synced yet. "Continue watching", the category sections and "Quick watches" SHALL be hidden when they have no videos or when they cannot be loaded. While the home videos are loading, the view SHALL show placeholders as described in "Loading Placeholders" and no section heading. Section headings SHALL be set in the heading typeface, larger and bolder than card titles.

### Requirement: Detail View Page Header
A playlist or channel detail view SHALL open with a page header showing the playlist's or channel's name, with the channel's avatar beside it for channels. Below the name it SHALL show a summary of the number of videos and, when above 0, the number of unwatched videos, also for a playlist whose count is hidden. The header SHALL offer, in this order, a sync (reconcile) action; for both, an action to mark the entry watched; for playlists an action labeled "Exclude from home" when the playlist is shown on home or "Include in home" when it is excluded, which changes that setting without confirmation, and the hide or show unwatched count action; for both, an "Edit settings" action that opens the edit channel or playlist dialog; and last, an action to delete the entry. At or above the desktop breakpoint every action but delete SHALL be a square icon-only button whose accessible name and tooltip are the action's label, followed by a vertical "⋮" control, named "More actions for <name>", whose menu offers delete, styled as destructive. Below the desktop breakpoint the header SHALL show only that "⋮" control, always visible, whose menu offers every action, sync included, with delete set apart from the others.

The header SHALL be tinted with the soft tint of the category's color and SHALL show the category's name, a summary of its number of sources, its number of videos and, when above 0, its number of unwatched videos, and the same actions layout as the channel and playlist views' page header, offering "Change color", which opens the category color picker and saves the chosen color immediately, "Manage sources", which opens the manage sources dialog, "Mark all watched" (only when the category has sources), which marks every downloaded video of the category watched after the confirmation described in "Confirm Bulk Mark Watched", and "Delete", which deletes the category after the same confirmation as the sidebar row's "Delete" and then navigates to the home view; at or above the desktop breakpoint "Delete" SHALL be in the "More actions" menu as on the channel and playlist views. When the category is known from the categories list, the header SHALL show its name and tint at once, before its videos load, with a placeholder in place of the summary; the videos SHALL show as placeholders as described in "Loading Placeholders" until they load. A category with no sources SHALL say so and offer a control that opens the manage sources dialog. A category with sources but without downloaded videos SHALL say it has no videos yet.

- **WHEN** a user opens a category with no sources
- **THEN** the view says it holds no channels or playlists yet and offers a control that opens the manage sources dialog

#### Scenario: Unknown category
- **WHEN** a user opens the view of a category that does not exist
- **THEN** the view says the category was not found

### Requirement: Sidebar Categories List
The sidebar SHALL show a "Categories" section above the Channels section listing every category, never trimmed, each row showing a dot in the category's color, the category's name and, when its unwatched count is above 0, that count. Selecting a row SHALL navigate to that category's view, and while the user is on it, its row SHALL be marked active.

#### Scenario: Categories listed above channels
- **WHEN** the categories "Chess" and "Sports" exist
- **THEN** the sidebar shows a "Categories" section above "Channels" listing both

#### Scenario: Color dot
- **WHEN** the category "Chess" is colored "#0193bf"
- **THEN** its row shows a "#0193bf" dot before its name

#### Scenario: Every category shown
- **WHEN** 25 categories exist and the Categories section is unfolded
- **THEN** all 25 are listed, with no show-more control

#### Scenario: Category badge
- **WHEN** the category "Chess" has 12 unwatched videos and "Science" has none
- **THEN** the "Chess" row shows the count 12 and the "Science" row shows no count

#### Scenario: Opening a category
- **WHEN** a user selects the "Chess" row
- **THEN** the application navigates to the "Chess" category view and marks the row active

#### Scenario: Search filters categories
- **WHEN** the categories "Chess" and "Science" exist and a user types "sci" in the header search
- **THEN** the search's Categories group lists only "Science", and the sidebar's Categories section still lists both

### Requirement: Category Color Picker
The category color picker SHALL offer the 10 palette colors as swatches in palette order, each a radio option named Mustard, Orange, Coral, Rose, Violet, Periwinkle, Sky, Teal, Olive and Taupe, plus a "Custom" option with a hue slider. Every custom color SHALL have the palette's solid lightness and saturation, so only the hue changes. The chosen option SHALL be shown checked. A color not in the palette SHALL show as "Custom" with the slider at its hue.

#### Scenario: Choosing a swatch
- **WHEN** a user chooses the "Sky" swatch
- **THEN** "Sky" is shown checked and the chosen color is "#0193bf"

#### Scenario: Clicking a swatch
- **WHEN** a user clicks anywhere on the "Violet" swatch
- **THEN** "Violet" is shown checked

#### Scenario: Choosing a custom hue
- **WHEN** a user chooses "Custom" and moves the hue slider
- **THEN** the chosen color follows the hue and keeps the palette's solid lightness and saturation

#### Scenario: Existing custom color
- **WHEN** the picker opens for a category whose color is not in the palette
- **THEN** "Custom" is shown checked with the slider at that color's hue

### Requirement: Tasks View Tab Bar Affordance
The tasks view's tab bar SHALL make each tab look clickable and SHALL make the selected tab unmistakable. The tasks view SHALL be limited to a readable width and aligned to the left edge of the content area, like the other views, and the tab bar SHALL span exactly the width of the task list, its tabs sharing that width equally. The tab bar SHALL be drawn as a row of tabs over a horizontal rule, with the selected tab marked by an underline in the application's primary colour and its label in the full foreground colour and a heavier weight; unselected tabs SHALL show a muted label. Hovering an unselected tab SHALL visibly change its background and label colour. Each tab SHALL show an icon for its family, its name, and its count as a pill, with the selected tab's pill in the primary colour. On narrow screens each tab SHALL show only its icon and count, keeping its name as its accessible name, so that all tabs fit without horizontal scrolling. While at least one task is running, the **Active** tab SHALL show a live indicator beside its count. Each tab SHALL be at least 40 pixels tall and SHALL show a visible focus ring when focused from the keyboard. The tab bar SHALL look the same whatever the operating system's colour-scheme preference.

#### Scenario: Selected tab is marked
- **WHEN** a user views the tasks view with the Syncs tab selected
- **THEN** the Syncs tab shows the primary-coloured underline, a full-colour heavier label, and a primary-coloured count pill, and no other tab does

#### Scenario: Hovering an unselected tab
- **WHEN** a user hovers an unselected tab with a pointer
- **THEN** that tab's background and label colour change

#### Scenario: Live indicator on Active
- **WHEN** at least one task is running
- **THEN** the Active tab shows a live indicator beside its count

#### Scenario: No live indicator when idle
- **WHEN** no task is running
- **THEN** the Active tab shows no live indicator

#### Scenario: Keyboard focus
- **WHEN** a user moves keyboard focus onto a tab
- **THEN** that tab shows a visible focus ring

#### Scenario: Wide screen
- **WHEN** the tasks view is shown on a wide desktop screen
- **THEN** the view is left-aligned at a readable width, its left edge matching the other views' content, and the tab bar's rule and the task list share the same left and right edges

#### Scenario: Narrow screen
- **WHEN** the tasks view is shown on a phone-width screen
- **THEN** every tab shows its icon and count without its visible name, all four tabs are visible without scrolling, and each tab is still announced by its name to assistive technology

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Home Card Category Tint
**Reason**: Pastel card tints fought the thumbnails, carried no information in category sections, and turned into bands that read as a bug for videos in several categories.
**Migration**: Categories show as text chips on mixed home sections ("Home Card Category Chips"); cards are frameless ("Video Card Presentation").

### Requirement: Sidebar Search Field
**Reason**: Replaced by the header's global search, which finds categories, channels, playlists and videos.
**Migration**: Use the header "Search" control or ⌘K/Ctrl+K ("Global Search").

### Requirement: Sidebar Search Filtering
**Reason**: Replaced by the header's global search.
**Migration**: Use "Global Search"; its Categories, Channels and Playlists groups match names the same way, ignoring case.
