## Purpose

Lets a caller create, delete, and list the YouTube channels the daemon tracks by handle, so a future sync capability has a persisted set of channels to poll for new uploads.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Create Channel
The system SHALL provide an HTTP endpoint that creates a channel given a `channel` value that is either a YouTube channel handle (e.g. `@somechannel`) or a YouTube channel URL carrying a handle (e.g. `https://www.youtube.com/@somechannel`), a quality tier (`high`, `mid`, or `low`), a video limit that is an integer from 1 to 1000 inclusive, the number of the channel's most recent videos to keep synced, and a storage path. The system SHALL extract the handle from the `channel` value when it is a URL, resolve that handle against the YouTube Data API to confirm it corresponds to an existing, accessible channel and to obtain that channel's immutable YouTube channel ID and display title, and store the channel with the handle as its ID, the resolved title as its name, the resolved immutable channel ID, the quality, the video limit, the path, and a system-generated creation timestamp.

The stored ID is the handle, not the immutable channel ID, so the HTTP surface stays human-readable (e.g. `DELETE /channels/@somechannel`). The immutable ID is stored alongside it because a handle can be changed later by the channel's owner, while the immutable ID cannot.

When deciding whether a channel already exists in storage, the system SHALL compare handles ignoring case, since YouTube treats handles that differ only in case (`@Name`, `@name`) as the same channel.

The storage path identifies where the channel's videos are saved, relative to the configured videos root directory, and may contain multiple `/`-separated segments to express nested subdirectories (e.g. `creators/somechannel`), the same as a playlist's storage path.

#### Scenario: Successful creation from a bare handle
- **WHEN** a request supplies a `channel` value that is a bare handle that resolves to an existing YouTube channel, a valid quality, a valid video limit, and a valid path
- **THEN** the system persists a channel record with that handle as its ID, the channel's resolved title as its name, the resolved immutable channel ID, the quality, the video limit, the path, and a creation timestamp, and returns the created channel

#### Scenario: Successful creation from a channel URL
- **WHEN** a request supplies a `channel` value that is a full YouTube channel URL (e.g. `https://www.youtube.com/@somechannel`) whose handle resolves to an existing YouTube channel, a valid quality, a valid video limit, and a valid path
- **THEN** the system extracts the handle from the URL, persists a channel record the same way as the bare-handle case, and returns the created channel

#### Scenario: Duplicate channel handle
- **WHEN** a request supplies a `channel` value (bare handle or URL) whose handle already exists in storage
- **THEN** the system accepts the request but makes no change because the endpoint is idempotent, and returns the existing channel record

#### Scenario: Duplicate channel handle in a different case
- **WHEN** a request supplies a `channel` value whose handle differs only in case from one already in storage (e.g. `@SomeChannel` when `@somechannel` is stored)
- **THEN** the system makes no change and returns the existing channel record, with its stored handle

#### Scenario: Duplicate channel handle with a different quality
- **WHEN** a request supplies a `channel` value whose handle already exists in storage, with a quality value different from the stored record's
- **THEN** the system makes no change, ignores the request's quality value, and returns the existing record with its original quality

#### Scenario: Duplicate channel handle with a different video limit
- **WHEN** a request supplies a `channel` value whose handle already exists in storage, with a video limit different from the stored record's
- **THEN** the system makes no change, ignores the request's video limit, and returns the existing record with its original video limit

#### Scenario: Duplicate channel handle with a different path
- **WHEN** a request supplies a `channel` value whose handle already exists in storage, with a path value different from the stored record's
- **THEN** the system makes no change, ignores the request's path value, and returns the existing record with its original path

#### Scenario: Missing or empty channel value
- **WHEN** a request omits the `channel` field, or supplies an empty or whitespace-only value
- **THEN** the system rejects the request without persisting anything and without checking YouTube and returns a bad request with a meaningful error description

#### Scenario: Handle missing its leading @
- **WHEN** a request supplies a bare `channel` value that does not start with `@`
- **THEN** the system rejects the request without persisting anything and without checking YouTube and returns a bad request with a meaningful error description

#### Scenario: Unrecognized URL
- **WHEN** a request supplies a `channel` value that is a URL but not a recognized YouTube URL
- **THEN** the system rejects the request without persisting anything and without checking YouTube and returns a bad request with a meaningful error description

#### Scenario: YouTube URL missing a handle
- **WHEN** a request supplies a `channel` value that is a recognized YouTube URL with no handle segment (e.g. a legacy `/channel/UC...` URL)
- **THEN** the system rejects the request without persisting anything and without checking YouTube and returns a bad request with a meaningful error description

#### Scenario: Nonexistent YouTube channel
- **WHEN** a request supplies a `channel` value whose extracted handle does not correspond to an existing, accessible YouTube channel
- **THEN** the system rejects the request without persisting anything and returns a bad request with a meaningful error description

#### Scenario: Missing or invalid quality
- **WHEN** a request omits quality, or supplies a value that is not `high`, `mid`, or `low`
- **THEN** the system rejects the request without persisting anything and without checking YouTube and returns a bad request with a meaningful error description

#### Scenario: Missing or invalid video limit
- **WHEN** a request omits the video limit, or supplies a value that is not an integer from 1 to 1000 inclusive
- **THEN** the system rejects the request without persisting anything and without checking YouTube and returns a bad request with a meaningful error description

#### Scenario: Video limit above the maximum
- **WHEN** a request supplies a video limit greater than 1000, including values too large to fit in 32 bits
- **THEN** the system rejects the request without persisting anything and without checking YouTube and returns a bad request whose error description states the accepted range of 1 to 1000 and the value received

#### Scenario: Video limit at the bounds
- **WHEN** a request supplies a video limit of exactly 1 or exactly 1000, with every other field valid
- **THEN** the system persists the channel with that exact video limit and returns it unchanged

#### Scenario: Missing or invalid path
- **WHEN** a request omits path, supplies an empty path, or supplies a path that is absolute, contains a `..` segment, or contains an empty segment (e.g. leading/trailing/doubled `/`)
- **THEN** the system rejects the request without persisting anything and without checking YouTube and returns a bad request with a meaningful error description

### Requirement: Preview a YouTube Channel
The system SHALL provide an HTTP endpoint that, given a `channel` value that is either a YouTube channel handle or a YouTube channel URL carrying a handle, looks the channel up on YouTube and returns its handle, its YouTube title, and the URL of its avatar image as YouTube reports it (or no avatar when YouTube reports none), without persisting anything, storing any avatar, publishing any event, or scheduling any task. It applies the same handle extraction and validation as Create Channel.

The preview is independent of what is already tracked: previewing a channel that is already stored SHALL return its YouTube data like any other.

#### Scenario: Previewing a channel by handle
- **WHEN** a request supplies the handle `@somechannel` of a YouTube channel titled "Some Channel" with an avatar
- **THEN** the system returns the handle `@somechannel`, the title "Some Channel" and the avatar's URL, and storage, the avatar store, events and tasks are unchanged

#### Scenario: Previewing a channel by URL
- **WHEN** a request supplies a YouTube channel URL carrying a handle (e.g. `https://www.youtube.com/@somechannel/videos`)
- **THEN** the system returns the extracted handle `@somechannel` together with its YouTube title and avatar URL

#### Scenario: Previewing a channel without an avatar
- **WHEN** a request identifies a YouTube channel for which YouTube reports no avatar
- **THEN** the system returns its handle and title with no avatar

#### Scenario: Previewing an invalid value
- **WHEN** a request omits the value, or supplies an empty value, a handle missing its leading `@`, a URL that is not a recognized YouTube URL, or a YouTube URL without a handle
- **THEN** the system returns a bad request with a meaningful error description without contacting YouTube

#### Scenario: Previewing a nonexistent channel
- **WHEN** a request supplies a handle that does not correspond to an existing, accessible YouTube channel
- **THEN** the system returns a not found response with a meaningful error description

#### Scenario: YouTube unavailable
- **WHEN** the YouTube lookup itself fails
- **THEN** the system returns a bad gateway response with a meaningful error description

### Requirement: Delete Channel
The system SHALL provide an HTTP endpoint that deletes a previously created channel identified by its handle. Deleting a channel SHALL also remove its pending recurring reconcile, so no reconcile of the channel stays queued after it is gone.

#### Scenario: Successful deletion
- **WHEN** a request identifies a channel handle that exists in storage
- **THEN** the system removes it and confirms the deletion

#### Scenario: Deleting a channel with a pending reconcile
- **WHEN** a request deletes a channel whose next recurring reconcile is pending
- **THEN** by the time the system confirms the deletion, no reconcile of that channel is pending, and pending tasks of other channels and playlists are unchanged

#### Scenario: Channel added again after deletion
- **WHEN** a channel is deleted and then created again with the same handle
- **THEN** the channel has a single recurring reconcile chain, as if it had never been tracked before

#### Scenario: Deleting a nonexistent channel
- **WHEN** a request identifies a channel handle that does not exist in storage
- **THEN** the system reports that nothing was found, makes no change to storage, and returns a bad request with a meaningful error description

### Requirement: List Channels
The system SHALL provide an HTTP endpoint that returns every currently stored channel, sorted alphabetically by name, ignoring case. Each returned channel SHALL include only its handle, name, path, quality, video limit, reconcile interval in minutes and avatar filename (when present), plus its count of unwatched videos, counting only videos that have finished downloading.

#### Scenario: Channels exist
- **WHEN** one or more channels have been created
- **THEN** the system returns all of them, each with only its handle, name, path, quality, video limit, reconcile interval in minutes, avatar filename (when present), and unwatched video count

#### Scenario: No channels exist
- **WHEN** no channels have been created
- **THEN** the system returns an empty list rather than an error

#### Scenario: Unwatched count only includes downloaded, unwatched videos
- **WHEN** a channel has downloaded videos that are unwatched, downloaded videos that are watched, and videos that have not finished downloading
- **THEN** its unwatched video count equals the number of downloaded, unwatched videos only

#### Scenario: Channels are sorted by name regardless of creation order
- **WHEN** channels named "veritasium", "Kurzgesagt" and "3Blue1Brown" were created in that order
- **THEN** the system returns them in the order "3Blue1Brown", "Kurzgesagt", "veritasium"

### Requirement: Channel Avatar Is Recorded
The system SHALL record, on the channel itself, the local filename of its downloaded avatar image, whenever one was successfully resolved and downloaded during channel creation or restored by a channel reconcile pass (see `channel-avatars`). A channel whose avatar could not be resolved or downloaded SHALL have no recorded avatar filename, unless one was recorded earlier.

#### Scenario: Channel created with an avatar
- **WHEN** channel creation resolves and downloads an avatar image for the channel
- **THEN** the channel's recorded avatar filename becomes the local filename of that image

#### Scenario: Channel created without an avatar
- **WHEN** channel creation does not obtain an avatar image, whether because none was available or because downloading it failed
- **THEN** the channel has no recorded avatar filename

#### Scenario: Avatar restored by a reconcile pass
- **WHEN** a channel reconcile pass restores a missing avatar and stores it under a filename different from the recorded one
- **THEN** the channel's recorded avatar filename becomes the new local filename

### Requirement: Channel Creation Publishes a Domain Event
The system SHALL publish a ChannelCreated domain event, containing the channel's handle, whenever a channel is newly created — and SHALL NOT publish it when creation is a no-op because the channel already existed.

#### Scenario: New channel created
- **WHEN** a create-channel request results in a new channel being persisted
- **THEN** the system publishes a ChannelCreated event containing that channel's handle

#### Scenario: Channel already existed
- **WHEN** a create-channel request identifies a handle that already exists in storage
- **THEN** the system does not publish a ChannelCreated event

### Requirement: Channel Deletion Publishes a Domain Event
The system SHALL publish a ChannelDeleted domain event, containing the channel's handle, whenever a channel is successfully deleted.

#### Scenario: Existing channel deleted
- **WHEN** a delete-channel request successfully removes a channel from storage
- **THEN** the system publishes a ChannelDeleted event containing that channel's handle

#### Scenario: Deleting a nonexistent channel
- **WHEN** a delete-channel request identifies a handle that does not exist in storage
- **THEN** the system does not publish a ChannelDeleted event

### Requirement: Update Channel Settings
The system SHALL provide an HTTP endpoint that changes the quality, video limit and/or reconcile interval of a stored channel identified by its handle, and returns the channel as stored. Each field is optional and validated as on creation; an absent field keeps its stored value, and at least one SHALL be supplied. The handle, name, path and avatar SHALL NOT change. Quality and video limit apply from the channel's next sync. A new reconcile interval SHALL apply from the next scheduled reconcile on: when the channel's pending recurring reconcile is due later than the update time plus the new interval, the system SHALL move it to the update time plus the new interval; otherwise the pending reconcile keeps its time. The update publishes no domain event.

#### Scenario: Changing the quality
- **WHEN** a request supplies quality `low` for a stored channel whose quality is `high`
- **THEN** the system stores the channel with quality `low` and its other fields unchanged, and returns it

#### Scenario: Changing the video limit
- **WHEN** a request supplies video limit 20 for a stored channel whose video limit is 5
- **THEN** the system stores the channel with video limit 20 and its other fields unchanged, and returns it

#### Scenario: Changing the reconcile interval
- **WHEN** a request supplies `reconcile_interval_minutes` 60 for a stored channel whose interval is 180
- **THEN** the system stores the channel with a reconcile interval of 60 minutes and its other fields unchanged, and returns it

#### Scenario: Shortening the interval brings the pending reconcile forward
- **WHEN** a channel's pending recurring reconcile is due in 20 hours and a request changes its interval to 60 minutes
- **THEN** the pending reconcile becomes due 60 minutes after the update

#### Scenario: Lengthening the interval keeps the pending reconcile
- **WHEN** a channel's pending recurring reconcile is due in 30 minutes and a request changes its interval to 1440 minutes
- **THEN** the pending reconcile stays due in 30 minutes, and the reconcile after it is scheduled 1440 minutes after that one finishes

#### Scenario: Changing the interval while a reconcile is running
- **WHEN** a request changes a channel's interval while a reconcile of that channel is running and none is pending
- **THEN** the running reconcile, when it finishes, schedules the next one after the new interval

#### Scenario: Changing both settings
- **WHEN** a request supplies a quality, a video limit and a reconcile interval for a stored channel
- **THEN** the system stores all new values and returns the updated channel

#### Scenario: Setting the values the channel already has
- **WHEN** a request supplies the quality, video limit and reconcile interval the channel already has
- **THEN** the system makes no change and returns the channel as stored

#### Scenario: Nothing to update
- **WHEN** a request supplies none of quality, video limit and reconcile interval
- **THEN** the system rejects the request without changing storage and returns a bad request with a meaningful error description

#### Scenario: Invalid quality or video limit
- **WHEN** a request supplies a quality that is not `high`, `mid` or `low`, a video limit that is not an integer from 1 to 1000 inclusive, or a reconcile interval that is not a whole number from 1 to 1440
- **THEN** the system rejects the request without changing storage and returns a bad request with the same error description as on creation

#### Scenario: Updating a nonexistent channel
- **WHEN** a request identifies a channel handle that does not exist in storage
- **THEN** the system makes no change to storage and returns a not found response with a meaningful error description

#### Scenario: New quality applies to later downloads only
- **WHEN** a channel's quality is changed and the channel then syncs and finds a new video
- **THEN** that video is downloaded at the new quality, while videos already downloaded or already queued for download keep the quality they had

#### Scenario: New video limit applies at the next sync
- **WHEN** a channel's video limit is changed and the channel then syncs
- **THEN** the sync keeps the channel's most recent uploads up to the new limit, downloading newly included videos and removing videos beyond it as `channel-video-sync` describes

### Requirement: Channel Reconcile Interval
Every stored channel SHALL have a reconcile interval: a whole number of minutes from 1 to 1440 (24 hours), setting how long after one recurring reconcile of the channel finishes the next one runs. Creating a channel SHALL accept an optional `reconcile_interval_minutes`; when it is omitted the channel is stored with 180 minutes (3 hours). Channels stored before reconcile intervals existed SHALL have 180 minutes. The created channel's response SHALL include its `reconcile_interval_minutes`.

#### Scenario: Creating a channel without an interval
- **WHEN** a valid creation request omits `reconcile_interval_minutes`
- **THEN** the system persists the channel with a reconcile interval of 180 minutes, and returns it with `reconcile_interval_minutes` 180

#### Scenario: Creating a channel with an interval
- **WHEN** a valid creation request supplies `reconcile_interval_minutes` 30
- **THEN** the system persists the channel with a reconcile interval of 30 minutes, and returns it with `reconcile_interval_minutes` 30

#### Scenario: Invalid interval on creation
- **WHEN** a creation request supplies a `reconcile_interval_minutes` that is not a whole number from 1 to 1440
- **THEN** the system rejects the request without persisting anything and without checking YouTube and returns a bad request whose error description states the bound it breaks (at least 1 minute, at most 1440 minutes) and the value received

#### Scenario: Duplicate channel handle with a different interval
- **WHEN** a request supplies a `channel` value whose handle already exists in storage, with a `reconcile_interval_minutes` different from the stored record's
- **THEN** the system makes no change, ignores the request's interval, and returns the existing record with its original interval

#### Scenario: Channels existing before the upgrade
- **WHEN** the system starts on a database whose channels were stored before reconcile intervals existed
- **THEN** every such channel has a reconcile interval of 180 minutes
