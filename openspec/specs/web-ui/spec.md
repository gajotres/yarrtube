# web-ui Specification

## Purpose

Serves a browsable single-page application from the daemon's own HTTP server, so tracked playlists, their videos, and in-flight tasks can be inspected from a browser without a separate deployment or a database client.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Serve The Application Shell
The system SHALL serve the single-page application's HTML page at `GET /`, without requiring authentication.

#### Scenario: Root request
- **WHEN** a client sends `GET /` to the running daemon
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 200 and the application's HTML

### Requirement: Serve Application Assets
The system SHALL serve every static asset (script, stylesheet, and other build output) the application's HTML page references, without requiring authentication.

#### Scenario: Asset request
- **WHEN** a client requests one of the application's referenced asset files
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 200 and that asset's content

### Requirement: Self-Contained Deployment
The system SHALL serve the application and its assets using only the running binary, without requiring any additional file, directory, or volume to be present at runtime.

#### Scenario: Fresh deployment with no extra files
- **WHEN** the daemon is started with only its binary present (no application source or build output mounted or copied alongside it)
- **THEN** requests to the application's root and its assets still succeed as in the scenarios above

### Requirement: Client-Side Routing
The application SHALL expose a distinct, navigable client-side URL for each top-level view: the home view, a playlist detail view (per playlist ID), a channel detail view (per channel ID), and the tasks view. Navigating between these views SHALL update the browser's URL and SHALL support the browser's back and forward navigation.

#### Scenario: Navigating to a detail view updates the URL
- **WHEN** a user navigates from the home view to a playlist's or channel's detail view
- **THEN** the browser's URL changes to reflect that specific playlist or channel

#### Scenario: Browser back returns to the previous view
- **WHEN** a user is on a detail view reached by navigating from the home view, and uses the browser's back action
- **THEN** the application returns to the home view

#### Scenario: Loading a detail view's URL directly
- **WHEN** a user loads a playlist's or channel's detail URL directly (e.g. via reload or a bookmark)
- **THEN** the application renders that playlist's or channel's detail view without requiring navigation through the home view first

### Requirement: Deep-Linkable Video Selection
A playlist or channel detail view's URL SHALL support identifying a specific video within it, such that loading that URL selects that video the way clicking it in the video list would.

#### Scenario: Navigating from a home video card selects that video
- **WHEN** a user clicks a video card on the home view
- **THEN** the application navigates to that video's playlist's or channel's detail view with that video already selected

### Requirement: Logo Returns To Home
Clicking the application's logo, from any view, SHALL navigate to the home view.

#### Scenario: Clicking the logo from a detail view
- **WHEN** a user is on a playlist detail view, a channel detail view, or the tasks view, and clicks the application logo
- **THEN** the application navigates to the home view

### Requirement: Persistent Header
At or above the small breakpoint, the application header SHALL remain fixed in place (visible, non-scrolling) as the user scrolls any view. Below the small breakpoint, the header SHALL be 56 pixels tall and SHALL slide out of view while the user scrolls the document down, and slide back as soon as the user scrolls up. It SHALL stay visible while the document is at its top, while the mobile sidebar is open, and while a video player is pinned below it. The header's logo SHALL occupy its final size before the logo image loads, so the header's contents do not shift when it appears.

#### Scenario: Scrolling a view with a tall content area
- **WHEN** a user on a desktop-width viewport scrolls a view whose content exceeds the visible viewport height
- **THEN** the header remains visible in place and does not move with the scrolled content

#### Scenario: Scrolling down on a phone
- **WHEN** a user on a phone-width viewport scrolls the home view down
- **THEN** the header slides out of view

#### Scenario: Scrolling back up on a phone
- **WHEN** a user on a phone-width viewport whose header is hidden scrolls up
- **THEN** the header slides back into view straight away

#### Scenario: Pinned player on a phone
- **WHEN** a user on a phone-width viewport scrolls a channel view whose player is pinned below the header
- **THEN** the header stays visible

#### Scenario: Scrolling on a mobile viewport as the browser's UI chrome shows or hides
- **WHEN** a user on a mobile browser scrolls a view while the browser's own toolbar collapses or expands
- **THEN** the header hides and returns only with the user's scroll direction, and is not displaced by the toolbar's movement

#### Scenario: Logo loading
- **WHEN** the application loads and the logo image has not arrived yet
- **THEN** the space for the logo is already reserved, and the header's other contents do not move when it arrives

### Requirement: Home Page Layout
The home view SHALL display its sections in this order: "Continue watching", up to 3 category sections, "Quick watches" and "Latest videos", loaded together in one request. A video SHALL appear in at most one section. "Latest videos" SHALL display up to 18 recently synced videos. "Continue watching" SHALL display up to 6 videos the user has started and not finished recently. "Quick watches" SHALL display up to 6 short unwatched videos. Each category section SHALL display up to 6 videos, as described in "Home Category Sections". "Continue watching", the category sections and "Quick watches" SHALL be laid out as described in "Home Shelves"; "Latest videos" as a grid, and below the small breakpoint as described in "Mobile Latest Videos Feed". Cards SHALL be presented as described in "Video Card Presentation". "Latest videos" SHALL be hidden when it has no videos while another section has videos; when no section has videos, "Latest videos" SHALL be shown saying no videos have been synced yet. "Continue watching", the category sections and "Quick watches" SHALL be hidden when they have no videos or when they cannot be loaded. While the home videos are loading, the view SHALL show placeholders as described in "Loading Placeholders" and no section heading. Section headings SHALL be set in the heading typeface, larger and bolder than card titles.

#### Scenario: Home view with recent videos
- **WHEN** one or more videos have been synced
- **THEN** the home view renders them under "Latest videos" as a grid of thumbnail-and-title cards

#### Scenario: Channel video card
- **WHEN** a video in any home section comes from a tracked channel
- **THEN** its card shows the channel's avatar beside the title and the channel's name on its meta line

#### Scenario: Playlist video card
- **WHEN** a video in any home section comes from a tracked playlist
- **THEN** its card shows a playlist icon beside the title and the playlist's name on its meta line

#### Scenario: Continue watching shown first
- **WHEN** at least one video has been started and not finished recently
- **THEN** the home view shows a "Continue watching" section above the other sections, listing that video

#### Scenario: Continue watching card shows progress
- **WHEN** a video is shown under "Continue watching"
- **THEN** its thumbnail shows a progress bar proportional to its saved playback position over its duration

#### Scenario: Quick watches shown above latest videos
- **WHEN** at least one short unwatched video has been downloaded and is not shown in a category section
- **THEN** the home view shows a "Quick watches" section below "Continue watching" and the category sections, and above "Latest videos", listing that video

#### Scenario: Sections show a bounded number of videos
- **WHEN** more videos qualify for a section than it shows
- **THEN** "Continue watching", each category section and "Quick watches" each hold at most 6 videos, and "Latest videos" shows at most 18

#### Scenario: A video appears in one section only
- **WHEN** a video qualifies for more than one home section
- **THEN** it is shown only in the first of them, in section order

#### Scenario: Empty sections are hidden
- **WHEN** no video qualifies for "Continue watching" or "Quick watches"
- **THEN** that section, including its heading, is not shown

#### Scenario: Empty latest videos hidden
- **WHEN** every video is shown under "Continue watching", a category section or "Quick watches"
- **THEN** "Latest videos", including its heading, is not shown

#### Scenario: Nothing synced yet
- **WHEN** no section has videos
- **THEN** "Latest videos" is shown with "No videos synced yet."

#### Scenario: Home videos loading
- **WHEN** the home videos are still loading
- **THEN** the view shows placeholder sections and no section heading, "Latest videos" included

#### Scenario: Optional sections that fail to load are hidden
- **WHEN** the home videos cannot be loaded
- **THEN** "Continue watching", the category sections and "Quick watches" are not shown, and "Latest videos" shows the load error

### Requirement: Persistent Channels And Playlists Sidebar
The application SHALL display a sidebar listing the titles of tracked channels and tracked playlists, each as a separate section, visible from every top-level view rather than only the home view. When the user is on a playlist's or channel's detail view, the sidebar SHALL mark that entry as active.

#### Scenario: Sidebar lists channels and playlists
- **WHEN** one or more channels and playlists are tracked
- **THEN** the sidebar lists each tracked channel's title under a "Channels" section and each tracked playlist's title under a "Playlists" section

#### Scenario: Selecting a sidebar entry
- **WHEN** a user clicks a channel or playlist title in the sidebar
- **THEN** the application navigates to that channel's or playlist's detail view

#### Scenario: Sidebar visible from a detail view
- **WHEN** a user is on a playlist detail view, a channel detail view, or the tasks view
- **THEN** the sidebar remains visible

#### Scenario: Active sidebar entry
- **WHEN** a user is on a playlist's or channel's detail view
- **THEN** the sidebar marks that playlist's or channel's entry as active

### Requirement: Collapsible Mobile Sidebar
On viewports narrower than the desktop breakpoint, the sidebar (channels and playlists navigation) SHALL be hidden by default and SHALL NOT occupy permanent layout space. The user SHALL be able to reveal it via a control in the header. That same header control SHALL dismiss it while it is open, SHALL indicate whether the sidebar is open (both visually, by showing a close icon while open, and to assistive technology), and SHALL be the sidebar's only close control. While the sidebar is open, the header SHALL remain visible and usable above it and its backdrop. The sidebar SHALL also be dismissed by a backdrop tap, pressing Escape, selecting a navigation item within it, activating the header's home link, or any other navigation to a different view. When open, it SHALL cover no more than about two thirds of a typical phone's width, leaving the view behind it visible. While it is open, the page behind it SHALL NOT scroll, whatever the sidebar contains. On viewports at or above the desktop breakpoint, the sidebar SHALL remain a persistent, always-visible panel, unaffected by this open/closed state.

#### Scenario: Opening the sidebar on a mobile viewport
- **WHEN** a user on a mobile-width viewport activates the header's sidebar control
- **THEN** the sidebar becomes visible over the current view, below the header
- **AND** the header control indicates the sidebar is open and offers to close it

#### Scenario: Header stays usable while the sidebar is open
- **WHEN** a user on a mobile-width viewport has the sidebar open
- **THEN** the header (home link, sidebar control, settings) remains visible and can be activated without first dismissing the sidebar

#### Scenario: Dismissing the sidebar on a mobile viewport
- **WHEN** a user on a mobile-width viewport, with the sidebar open, activates the header's sidebar control, taps outside the sidebar, presses Escape, or selects a channel or playlist in it
- **THEN** the sidebar is hidden again
- **AND** the header control indicates the sidebar is closed

#### Scenario: Navigating from the header closes the sidebar
- **WHEN** a user on a mobile-width viewport, with the sidebar open, activates the header's home link or navigates to another view from the header (e.g. Settings → Tasks)
- **THEN** the sidebar is hidden and the chosen view is shown

#### Scenario: A long navigation list on a mobile viewport
- **WHEN** a user on a mobile-width viewport opens the sidebar and it contains enough channels and playlists that its content exceeds the viewport height
- **THEN** the sidebar's own content scrolls internally and the page behind it does not scroll

#### Scenario: Scroll position survives opening the sidebar
- **WHEN** a user on a mobile-width viewport scrolls a view, opens the sidebar, and then dismisses it without navigating
- **THEN** the view is at the same scroll position as before the sidebar opened

#### Scenario: Desktop viewport is unaffected
- **WHEN** a user is on a viewport at or above the desktop breakpoint
- **THEN** the sidebar is always visible as a persistent side panel, regardless of the open/closed state used on mobile

### Requirement: Sidebar Add Entries
The sidebar's Channels section SHALL offer an "Add channel" control and its Playlists section an "Add playlist" control, visible whenever the section is unfolded. When the section has loaded with nothing tracked, the control SHALL be a full-width labelled row placed beneath the section heading. Otherwise (the section has rows, is still loading, or failed to load) the control SHALL be a compact "+" button at the trailing edge of the section heading, outside the heading's fold toggle, with the accessible name "Add channel" or "Add playlist" and that name as its tooltip. A folded section SHALL NOT show its add control. "Add channel" SHALL open the add channel dialog and "Add playlist" SHALL open the add playlist dialog. On viewports narrower than the desktop breakpoint, activating either control SHALL close the sidebar before the dialog is shown.

#### Scenario: Opening the add channel dialog from the sidebar
- **WHEN** a user activates "Add channel" in the sidebar's Channels section
- **THEN** the add channel dialog opens

#### Scenario: Opening the add playlist dialog from the sidebar
- **WHEN** a user activates "Add playlist" in the sidebar's Playlists section
- **THEN** the add playlist dialog opens

#### Scenario: Add entries with nothing tracked
- **WHEN** no channels or playlists are tracked and both sections are unfolded
- **THEN** both sections show a full-width labelled add row beneath their heading

#### Scenario: Heading add control once tracked
- **WHEN** at least one channel is tracked and the Channels section is unfolded
- **THEN** the "Channels" heading shows a "+" control named "Add channel", and no "Add channel" row is shown

#### Scenario: Folded section hides its add entry
- **WHEN** the Channels section is folded
- **THEN** no "Add channel" control is shown

#### Scenario: Adding from the mobile sidebar
- **WHEN** a user on a mobile-width viewport opens the sidebar and activates "Add channel" or "Add playlist"
- **THEN** the sidebar closes and the matching add dialog is shown

### Requirement: Header Settings Menu
The header SHALL offer, at its trailing edge, a settings control shown as a gear icon with the accessible name "Settings". Activating it SHALL open a menu with, in order, "Tasks", which navigates to the tasks view, "Preferences", which navigates to the preferences view, "AI", which navigates to the AI page, and "Report a bug", which opens `https://github.com/sergigp/yarrtube/issues/new` in a new browser tab. The header SHALL NOT show any other control for adding channels or playlists or for reaching the tasks view.

#### Scenario: Reaching the tasks view
- **WHEN** a user activates the header's settings control and chooses "Tasks"
- **THEN** the application navigates to the tasks view

#### Scenario: Reaching the preferences view
- **WHEN** a user activates the header's settings control and chooses "Preferences"
- **THEN** the application navigates to the preferences view

#### Scenario: Reaching the AI page
- **WHEN** a user activates the header's settings control and chooses "AI"
- **THEN** the application navigates to the AI page

#### Scenario: Reporting a bug
- **WHEN** a user activates the header's settings control and chooses "Report a bug"
- **THEN** the GitHub new issue page for yarrtube opens in a new tab and the application stays where it was

#### Scenario: Header controls
- **WHEN** a user views any page
- **THEN** the header shows the settings control and no "Add" or "Tasks" button

### Requirement: Header Dark Mode Switch
The header SHALL show, immediately before the settings control, a switch with the accessible name "Dark mode", checked while the UI is drawn in the dark theme. It SHALL be drawn as a pill-shaped track with a round knob: in light mode the knob sits at the start of a neutral track and shows a sun; in dark mode it sits at the end of a track in the primary green and shows a moon. Activating it SHALL draw the UI in the other theme at once and save that theme as the `theme` preference. When the save fails, the UI SHALL be drawn in the saved theme again. The switch SHALL be disabled until the preferences have loaded.

#### Scenario: Turning dark mode on
- **WHEN** a user in light mode activates the "Dark mode" switch
- **THEN** the UI is drawn in the dark theme, the switch is checked and shows a moon, and the `theme` preference is saved as `"dark"` along with every other preference unchanged

#### Scenario: Turning dark mode off
- **WHEN** a user in dark mode activates the "Dark mode" switch
- **THEN** the UI is drawn in the light theme, the switch is unchecked and shows a sun, and the `theme` preference is saved as `"light"`

#### Scenario: Save fails
- **WHEN** a user activates the "Dark mode" switch and saving the preferences fails
- **THEN** the UI returns to the theme it had before and the switch to its previous state

#### Scenario: Preferences still loading
- **WHEN** the preferences have not loaded yet
- **THEN** the "Dark mode" switch is disabled

### Requirement: Saved Theme
The web UI SHALL be drawn in the theme saved as the `theme` preference, on every browser and device, once the preferences load. To avoid a flash of the wrong theme on load, the browser SHALL remember the last theme it drew and draw it before the first paint; when the saved preference differs, the saved preference SHALL win as soon as it loads. In the dark theme, the browser's theme color SHALL match the dark header background.

#### Scenario: Another device chose dark mode
- **WHEN** the `theme` preference is `"dark"` and a user opens the web UI in a browser that has never drawn it
- **THEN** the UI is drawn in the dark theme once the preferences load and the "Dark mode" switch is checked

#### Scenario: Reloading in dark mode
- **WHEN** a user whose `theme` preference is `"dark"` reloads the page
- **THEN** the page is drawn dark from its first paint, without showing the light theme first

#### Scenario: Saved theme overrides the browser's last one
- **WHEN** a browser last drew the dark theme and the `theme` preference has since been saved as `"light"` elsewhere
- **THEN** the UI is drawn in the light theme once the preferences load

### Requirement: Category Tints In Dark Mode
In the dark theme, every place that fills a chip or header with the soft tint of a category's hue (home card chips, the chosen chips of the "Categories" field, a category view's header) SHALL instead use a dark tint of that hue, and every chip name drawn in the dark shade of that hue SHALL instead use a light shade of it. For every palette color, the light shade on the dark tint SHALL have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, and the dark tint SHALL keep the category's hue.

#### Scenario: Home card chip in dark mode
- **WHEN** a user in dark mode views a home card for a video in the "Chess" category whose color is Sky
- **THEN** the "Chess" chip is filled with a dark tint of sky blue and its name is in a light shade of sky blue

#### Scenario: Category header in dark mode
- **WHEN** a user in dark mode opens the "Chess" category view
- **THEN** its header is filled with a dark tint of the category's hue

### Requirement: Add Dialog Save To Suggestions
Both add dialogs SHALL show a "Save to" control directly below the ID/URL field, visible from the moment the dialog opens, whether or not anything has been entered. It SHALL present a single-choice list of candidate parent folders, exactly one of which is selected at any time:

- the mode's default parent (`playlists/` in the add playlist dialog, `channels/` in the add channel dialog), always present, even when no tracked item is stored under it;
- the parent folders of the storage locations of existing tracked items of the dialog's own kind (tracked playlists in the add playlist dialog, tracked channels in the add channel dialog), each showing its path and how many tracked items it contains, ordered by most recent use (the parent containing the most recently added tracked item first);
- a final "Choose another folder…" entry that reveals the parent folder browser.

The list SHALL show at most 5 candidate folders (the default parent plus up to 4 derived parents) besides the "Choose another folder…" entry; when more derived parents exist, the most recently used ones are shown. Selecting a candidate SHALL make it the parent folder, and the selected candidate SHALL be visibly marked.

The parent folder SHALL only ever be set by selecting a candidate or through the parent folder browser; it SHALL NOT be free-text.

#### Scenario: Save to list visible on open
- **WHEN** a user opens either add dialog without entering anything
- **THEN** the "Save to" list is visible, with a candidate already selected

#### Scenario: One click to a previously used folder
- **WHEN** playlists are tracked at `playlists/kids/contes` and `playlists/kids/fa-la-la`, and a user selects the `playlists/kids` candidate in the add playlist dialog
- **THEN** the parent folder becomes `playlists/kids` in that single action, and the destination notice updates to match

#### Scenario: Candidate shows its occupant count
- **WHEN** the `playlists/kids` candidate is derived from 2 tracked playlists stored under it
- **THEN** the candidate identifies `playlists/kids` and shows that it contains 2 tracked items

#### Scenario: Default parent offered with nothing under it
- **WHEN** no tracked playlist is stored directly under `playlists/`
- **THEN** the add playlist dialog still offers `playlists/` as a candidate

#### Scenario: More derived parents than the list shows
- **WHEN** tracked playlists are stored under more distinct parent folders than the list's cap
- **THEN** the list shows the most recently used parents up to the cap, followed by "Choose another folder…"

#### Scenario: Suggestions come from the dialog's own kind
- **WHEN** tracked playlists exist under `playlists/kids` but no tracked channel is stored under it
- **THEN** the add channel dialog does not offer `playlists/kids` as a derived candidate

#### Scenario: Fresh install
- **WHEN** no playlists or channels are tracked
- **THEN** each dialog's list offers only the mode's default parent and "Choose another folder…"

### Requirement: Remembered Save To Parent
The application SHALL remember, per browser and per dialog mode, the parent folder last submitted successfully from that dialog, and SHALL preselect it in the "Save to" list the next time the dialog opens. A remembered parent that is no longer among the list's candidates SHALL be ignored in favor of the mode's default parent. When the remembered state cannot be read or written, the dialog SHALL fall back to the default parent without an error.

#### Scenario: Repeat add into the same folder
- **WHEN** a user adds a playlist into `playlists/kids` and later reopens the add playlist dialog
- **THEN** `playlists/kids` is preselected, and submitting requires no location action at all

#### Scenario: Remembered parent per mode
- **WHEN** a user adds a playlist into `playlists/kids` and then opens the add channel dialog
- **THEN** the add channel dialog's preselection is unaffected by the playlist dialog's remembered parent

#### Scenario: Stale remembered parent
- **WHEN** the remembered parent no longer appears among the list's candidates
- **THEN** the mode's default parent is preselected instead, without an error

#### Scenario: Storage unavailable
- **WHEN** the browser's stored state cannot be read
- **THEN** the dialog opens with the mode's default parent preselected, without an error

### Requirement: Add Dialog Folder Name
Both add dialogs SHALL offer a folder name for the directory the videos are stored in, inside the "Advanced options" section. The folder name SHALL be a single path segment: the dialog SHALL reject a folder name containing `/` and SHALL reject an empty folder name, and SHALL NOT submit the request in either case.

The folder name SHALL be pre-filled automatically rather than left blank: in the add playlist dialog, from a filesystem-safe slug of the playlist's YouTube title once the playlist has been looked up; in the add channel dialog, from a filesystem-safe slug of the entered channel handle or URL. It SHALL keep recomputing as that source changes. Once the user edits the folder name directly, the system SHALL stop overwriting it with further automatic updates for the remainder of that dialog session.

The add playlist dialog SHALL NOT ask for a playlist name. The playlist is named after its YouTube title, and the folder name determines only the directory on disk.

#### Scenario: Folder name lives in advanced options
- **WHEN** a user opens either add dialog
- **THEN** the folder name field is hidden inside the collapsed "Advanced options" section

#### Scenario: No playlist name field
- **WHEN** a user opens the add playlist dialog
- **THEN** the dialog offers no field for the playlist's name

#### Scenario: Folder name pre-fills from the playlist's YouTube title
- **WHEN** a user enters the ID or URL of a playlist titled "Lofi Beats: Study Mix" in the add playlist dialog, without having edited the folder name field
- **THEN** once the playlist has been looked up, the folder name's value is `lofi-beats-study-mix`

#### Scenario: Folder name pre-fills from the channel handle or URL
- **WHEN** a user types a channel handle or URL in the add channel dialog, without having edited the folder name field
- **THEN** the folder name's value updates to a filesystem-safe slug of that handle

#### Scenario: Manual folder name edit stops further auto-fill
- **WHEN** a user types directly into the folder name field, and then enters a different playlist ID or URL, or continues editing the channel handle/URL field
- **THEN** the folder name's value no longer changes in response to those edits

#### Scenario: Folder name containing a path separator
- **WHEN** a user enters a folder name containing `/`
- **THEN** the dialog reports the folder name as invalid and does not submit the request

#### Scenario: Empty folder name
- **WHEN** a user leaves the folder name empty
- **THEN** the dialog reports the folder name as invalid and does not submit the request

### Requirement: Add Dialog Parent Folder Browsing
Both add dialogs SHALL let the user change the parent folder by browsing the directories under the videos root. The browser SHALL NOT be expanded by default; it SHALL be revealed by the "Save to" list's "Choose another folder…" entry, and SHALL open on the currently selected parent folder.

While the browser is open, the location being browsed SHALL be the selected parent folder, and the destination SHALL follow it. The browser SHALL offer a control that closes it, after which the chosen folder SHALL appear, selected, as a candidate in the "Save to" list for the remainder of that dialog session.

The browser SHALL list the immediate subdirectories of the location being browsed, so that the user can see what a parent already contains before naming a new directory inside it. Each listed directory that is already the storage location of an existing playlist or channel SHALL be identified as such, and SHALL name the playlist or channel that occupies it.

The browser SHALL display the location being browsed as a path whose every ancestor, including the videos root, is directly selectable, so that reaching an ancestor takes one action regardless of depth. Selecting a listed subdirectory SHALL descend into it.

The browser SHALL let the user name a directory that does not exist yet and adopt it as the parent, so that a new location can be established without creating it on the underlying storage by hand. Such a directory SHALL NOT be created at that moment; it is created together with the rest of the destination when the first video is downloaded, so abandoning the dialog leaves nothing behind on disk. While a parent that does not exist yet is selected, the browser SHALL show it as containing nothing rather than reporting an error. If the name given in the create-folder step matches a directory that already exists at that location, the browser SHALL descend into that existing directory instead of treating it as new.

#### Scenario: Revealing the browser
- **WHEN** a user activates "Choose another folder…" in either add dialog's "Save to" list
- **THEN** the browser opens on the currently selected parent folder and lists its immediate subdirectories

#### Scenario: Descending into a directory
- **WHEN** a user selects a listed directory in the browser
- **THEN** that directory becomes the parent folder and the browser lists its immediate subdirectories

#### Scenario: Closing the browser keeps the chosen folder
- **WHEN** a user browses to `playlists/kids/specials` and closes the browser
- **THEN** the "Save to" list shows `playlists/kids/specials` as its selected candidate

#### Scenario: Jumping to an ancestor
- **WHEN** a user is browsing a directory several levels below the videos root and selects one of its ancestors in the displayed path
- **THEN** that ancestor becomes the parent folder in a single action, and the browser lists its immediate subdirectories

#### Scenario: Occupied directories are identified
- **WHEN** the browser lists a directory that is the storage location of an existing playlist or channel
- **THEN** that entry is marked as occupied and names the playlist or channel using it

#### Scenario: Browsing at the videos root
- **WHEN** a user browses to the videos root
- **THEN** the browser offers nothing above it to select

#### Scenario: Adopting a parent folder that does not exist yet
- **WHEN** a user names a new directory in the browser's create-folder step and adopts it as the parent folder
- **THEN** that directory becomes the parent folder, the browser shows it as containing nothing, and nothing is created on disk at that moment

#### Scenario: Create-folder step naming a directory that already exists
- **WHEN** a user names a directory in the create-folder step that already exists at the location being browsed
- **THEN** the browser descends into that existing directory rather than adopting it as a new one

### Requirement: Add Playlist Lookup Notice
The add playlist dialog SHALL look the entered playlist up on YouTube once the playlist ID or URL field stops changing, and SHALL show a notice between the "Save to" list and the "Advanced options" section. No notice SHALL be shown while the field is empty. While the lookup is in progress the notice SHALL say that the playlist is being looked up. A lookup answered for a value the field no longer holds SHALL be ignored.

Once the playlist has been found, the notice SHALL state how many videos YouTube reports for the playlist, the playlist's YouTube title, and the absolute destination they will be downloaded to (the videos root, parent folder and folder name joined together). It SHALL update as the parent folder or folder name changes. The notice SHALL NOT offer a "change" action; the location is changed through the "Save to" list above it.

The notice SHALL instead be shown as an error, and the dialog SHALL NOT submit the request, when:

- the value is not a playlist ID or URL, or the playlist does not exist or is not accessible on YouTube, stating which;
- YouTube could not be reached, saying so;
- the playlist is already tracked, stating that it has already been added and the name it was added under;
- the destination is already the storage location of another playlist or channel, naming the destination and the playlist or channel occupying it.

When more than one applies, the first in this list SHALL be shown. The dialog SHALL NOT submit the request until the playlist has been found.

The add playlist dialog SHALL NOT show a separate destination preview or report which directories will be created or already exist.

#### Scenario: Notice hidden before a playlist is entered
- **WHEN** a user opens the add playlist dialog and the playlist ID or URL field is empty
- **THEN** no notice is shown and the dialog does not submit

#### Scenario: Notice states the video count, title and destination
- **WHEN** a user enters the ID of a playlist titled "Lofi beats" with 42 videos, without changing the selected parent or any advanced option
- **THEN** once looked up, the notice states that the 42 videos from "Lofi beats" will be downloaded to the videos root joined with `playlists/lofi-beats`

#### Scenario: Notice follows the location
- **WHEN** a user selects a different "Save to" candidate or changes the folder name
- **THEN** the notice's destination updates to match

#### Scenario: Notice offers no change action
- **WHEN** the notice is shown, as information or as a destination-in-use error
- **THEN** it contains no "change" action

#### Scenario: Value that is not a playlist
- **WHEN** a user enters a YouTube video URL without a `list` parameter
- **THEN** the notice is shown as an error explaining that the value is not a playlist, and the dialog does not submit the request

#### Scenario: Playlist not found
- **WHEN** a user enters the ID of a playlist that does not exist or is private
- **THEN** the notice is shown as an error stating that the playlist was not found, and the dialog does not submit the request

#### Scenario: Playlist already added
- **WHEN** a user enters the ID or URL of a playlist that is already tracked under the name "Lofi beats"
- **THEN** the notice is shown as an error stating that it was already added as "Lofi beats", and the dialog does not submit the request

#### Scenario: Destination already in use
- **WHEN** the composed destination is the storage location of another playlist or channel
- **THEN** the notice is shown as an error naming the destination and the playlist or channel occupying it, and the dialog does not submit the request

#### Scenario: Created playlist is named after its YouTube title
- **WHEN** a user submits the dialog for a playlist titled "Lofi beats"
- **THEN** the playlist appears in the sidebar as "Lofi beats"

### Requirement: Add Channel Lookup Notice
The add channel dialog SHALL look the entered channel up on YouTube once the channel handle or URL field stops changing, and SHALL show a notice between the "Save to" list and the "Advanced options" section. No notice SHALL be shown while the field is empty. While the lookup is in progress the notice SHALL say that the channel is being looked up. A lookup answered for a value the field no longer holds SHALL be ignored.

Once the channel has been found, the notice SHALL show the channel's avatar, when YouTube reports one, and state how many of the channel's latest videos will be downloaded (the video limit), the channel's YouTube title, and the absolute destination they will be downloaded to (the videos root, parent folder and folder name joined together). It SHALL update as the video limit, parent folder or folder name changes. The notice SHALL NOT offer a "change" action; the location is changed through the "Save to" list above it. The folder name continues to derive from the entered handle, not from the title.

The notice SHALL instead be shown as an error, and the dialog SHALL NOT submit the request, when:

- the value is not a channel handle or channel URL, or the channel does not exist or is not accessible on YouTube, stating which;
- YouTube could not be reached, saying so;
- the channel is already tracked, stating that it has already been added and the name it was added under;
- the destination is already the storage location of another playlist or channel, naming the destination and the playlist or channel occupying it.

When more than one applies, the first in this list SHALL be shown. The dialog SHALL NOT submit the request until the channel has been found.

The add channel dialog SHALL NOT show a separate destination preview or report which directories will be created or already exist.

#### Scenario: Notice hidden before a handle is entered
- **WHEN** a user opens the add channel dialog and the channel handle or URL field is empty
- **THEN** no notice is shown and the dialog does not submit

#### Scenario: Notice states the video limit and destination
- **WHEN** a user enters `@veritasium`, the handle of a channel titled "Veritasium", without changing the selected parent or any advanced option
- **THEN** once looked up, the notice shows the channel's avatar and states that the latest 3 videos from "Veritasium" will be downloaded to the videos root joined with `channels/veritasium`

#### Scenario: Channel without an avatar
- **WHEN** the entered channel has no avatar on YouTube
- **THEN** the notice shows a placeholder in the avatar's place and otherwise reads the same

#### Scenario: Notice follows the location and options
- **WHEN** a user changes the video limit, selects a different "Save to" candidate or changes the folder name
- **THEN** the notice's video count and destination update to match

#### Scenario: Notice offers no change action
- **WHEN** the notice is shown, as information or as a destination-in-use error
- **THEN** it contains no "change" action

#### Scenario: Value that is not a channel
- **WHEN** a user enters a value that is not a handle or channel URL, such as a handle without its leading `@`
- **THEN** the notice is shown as an error explaining why the value is not a channel, and the dialog does not submit the request

#### Scenario: Channel not found
- **WHEN** a user enters the handle of a channel that does not exist or is not accessible
- **THEN** the notice is shown as an error stating that the channel was not found, and the dialog does not submit the request

#### Scenario: Channel already added
- **WHEN** a user enters the handle or URL of a channel that is already tracked under the name "Veritasium"
- **THEN** the notice is shown as an error stating that it was already added as "Veritasium", and the dialog does not submit the request

#### Scenario: Destination already in use
- **WHEN** the composed destination is the storage location of another playlist or channel
- **THEN** the notice is shown as an error naming the destination and the playlist or channel occupying it, and the dialog does not submit the request

### Requirement: Add Dialog Download Options
Both add dialogs SHALL present video quality, the folder name and the "Check for new videos every" field inside a collapsed "Advanced options" section that is not expanded by default; the add channel dialog SHALL also present the video limit there, and the add playlist dialog SHALL also present an "Exclude from home" checkbox there, unchecked by default, whose value is sent as the playlist's `exclude_from_home` setting. The checkbox SHALL show always-visible hint text below its label reading "Videos from this playlist won't show up in home recommendations.", exposed as the checkbox's accessible description rather than behind a tooltip. The parent folder SHALL NOT be inside "Advanced options"; it is chosen through the always-visible "Save to" list. The video quality control SHALL be labeled "Video quality" and SHALL offer a tooltip explaining that it controls the download resolution and that a lower resolution reduces storage use. In the add channel dialog, the video limit field SHALL default to 3 and SHALL accept whole numbers from 1 to 1000. In both add dialogs, the interval field SHALL default to 3 hours, and its value SHALL be sent as the new source's `reconcile_interval_minutes`.

#### Scenario: Advanced options start collapsed
- **WHEN** a user opens either add dialog
- **THEN** the video quality control, the folder name, the interval field and, in the add channel dialog, the video limit field are hidden inside a collapsed "Advanced options" section

#### Scenario: Parent folder outside advanced options

- **THEN** the dialog flags the field as invalid and does not submit the request

#### Scenario: Interval default
- **WHEN** a user adds a channel or playlist without changing the interval field
- **THEN** it is created with `reconcile_interval_minutes` 180

#### Scenario: Adding with a custom interval
- **WHEN** a user sets the interval to 30 minutes in either add dialog and submits
- **THEN** the channel or playlist is created with `reconcile_interval_minutes` 30

#### Scenario: Exclude from home defaults to unchecked
- **WHEN** a user adds a playlist without touching the "Exclude from home" checkbox
- **THEN** the playlist is created with `exclude_from_home` `false`

#### Scenario: Adding a playlist excluded from home
- **WHEN** a user checks "Exclude from home" in the add playlist dialog and submits
- **THEN** the playlist is created with `exclude_from_home` `true`

#### Scenario: Exclude from home is explained
- **WHEN** a user expands "Advanced options" in the add playlist dialog
- **THEN** the "Exclude from home" checkbox shows the hint "Videos from this playlist won't show up in home recommendations." below its label, and assistive technology announces it as the checkbox's description

#### Scenario: Add channel dialog has no exclude from home option
- **WHEN** a user opens the add channel dialog and expands "Advanced options"
- **THEN** no "Exclude from home" checkbox is shown

### Requirement: Add Dialog Content Fit
Each add dialog SHALL show all of its content within the dialog's bounds, without horizontal clipping or horizontal scrolling, on any viewport at least as wide as the dialog itself — including with "Advanced options" expanded and with the parent folder browser open listing occupied folders with long names. A value too long for its row SHALL truncate within the row rather than widen the dialog or clip its neighbors.

#### Scenario: Browser open with long occupied labels
- **WHEN** a user opens the parent folder browser on a folder whose entries have long names and long "in use by" labels
- **THEN** every row stays inside the dialog's bounds, truncating its text as needed, and no content is clipped by the dialog's edge

#### Scenario: Expanded dialog on a desktop viewport
- **WHEN** a user expands "Advanced options" and the folder browser on a desktop-width viewport
- **THEN** the dialog shows all controls fully inside its bounds without a horizontal scrollbar

### Requirement: Add Dialog Dismissal
Neither add dialog SHALL close in response to a click outside the dialog. Each SHALL close in response to the Escape key or its explicit close control.

#### Scenario: Clicking outside the dialog
- **WHEN** an add dialog is open and a user clicks outside it
- **THEN** the dialog remains open

#### Scenario: Closing via Escape or the close control
- **WHEN** an add dialog is open and a user presses Escape or activates its close control
- **THEN** the dialog closes

### Requirement: Detail View Fixed Video Area
In a playlist or channel detail view on viewports at or above the desktop breakpoint, the video player and the selected video's detail pane SHALL remain fixed in place as the user scrolls; only the video list SHALL scroll. On viewports narrower than the desktop breakpoint, the document itself SHALL scroll. The video player SHALL stay pinned directly below the header, and the video detail pane and video list SHALL scroll with the page beneath it.

#### Scenario: Scrolling the video list
- **WHEN** a user on a desktop-width viewport scrolls the video list in a playlist or channel detail view
- **THEN** the video player and the video detail pane do not move

#### Scenario: Scrolling the video list on a mobile viewport
- **WHEN** a user on a mobile-width viewport scrolls a playlist or channel detail view
- **THEN** the document scrolls, the video player stays pinned directly below the header, and the video detail pane and video list move up beneath it

#### Scenario: Browser toolbars on a mobile browser
- **WHEN** a user on a mobile browser with collapsible or translucent toolbars scrolls a view
- **THEN** the page content extends behind the browser's toolbars and the browser is able to collapse them, as it does for any normally scrolling page

### Requirement: Video Detail Links To YouTube

### Requirement: Resume Playback
When a user plays a video in a playlist or channel detail view, the player SHALL start from the video's saved playback position if it is unwatched and has a saved position above 0. Otherwise it SHALL start from the beginning.

#### Scenario: Resuming a partly watched video
- **WHEN** a user opens an unwatched video with a saved playback position
- **THEN** playback starts from that position

#### Scenario: Opening a watched video
- **WHEN** a user opens a watched video
- **THEN** playback starts from the beginning

### Requirement: Report Playback Progress
While a video plays in a playlist or channel detail view, the application SHALL report the current playback position to the daemon at most every 15 seconds. It SHALL also report the position when playback pauses or ends, when the user switches to another video or leaves the view, and when the page is closed or hidden. Each report SHALL state whether the video was watched when the current playback session began.

- **THEN** the report states the video was unwatched, even if a refresh has since shown it watched

### Requirement: Playback Session Follows Watch State
A playlist or channel detail view's player SHALL track playback in sessions. A session SHALL begin when a video is loaded into the player, and SHALL record whether the video was watched at that moment. When the selected video's watched state changes while it is loaded, whether marked from this view, from its channel or elsewhere, the player SHALL begin a new session. It SHALL pause, return to the start of the video, and report nothing until playback moves on from there. After the user marks a video watched in the application, the selected video's watched state SHALL be refreshed promptly, without waiting for the periodic refresh.

#### Scenario: Marking the playing video watched
- **WHEN** a user marks the video that is playing as watched, then leaves the view
- **THEN** the player pauses at the start, no position from before the mark is reported, and the video stays watched

#### Scenario: Marking the channel watched while a video is loaded
- **WHEN** a user marks a channel watched while one of its partly watched videos is loaded in the player, then leaves the view
- **THEN** the video stays watched, leaves "Continue watching", and the channel's badge stays at 0

#### Scenario: Playing again after a mark
- **WHEN** a user presses play on a video after it was marked watched while loaded
- **THEN** playback starts from the beginning

### Requirement: Watched Tick On Video Thumbnails
Every video thumbnail in the playlist detail, channel detail, category and home views SHALL display a tick when that video is watched, and SHALL NOT display one when it is unwatched.

#### Scenario: Watched video thumbnail
- **WHEN** a watched video is listed in a playlist, channel, category or home view
- **THEN** its thumbnail displays a tick

#### Scenario: Unwatched video thumbnail
- **WHEN** an unwatched video is listed
- **THEN** its thumbnail does not display a tick

### Requirement: Unwatched Badge On Sidebar Channels
Each channel row in the sidebar SHALL display a badge with the channel's unwatched video count when that count is above 0, and no badge when it is 0. The badge SHALL update without a manual page reload. After an action in the application that changes a channel's unwatched count, the badge and the channel's sidebar position SHALL update promptly, without waiting for the periodic refresh. Such actions are: a video becoming watched or unwatched during playback, marking a single video watched, marking the channel watched, marking a playlist sharing its videos watched, syncing, and adding or deleting a channel. During playback, the channel and playlist lists SHALL be refetched only when a progress report changes the video's watched state.

- **THEN** the application refetches neither the channel list nor the playlist list because of it

#### Scenario: Badge updates after marking watched
- **WHEN** a user marks a channel watched from its sidebar row or its detail view
- **THEN** the channel's badge disappears promptly and the channel moves into the caught-up group

#### Scenario: Badge updates after marking a video watched
- **WHEN** a user marks one of a channel's unwatched videos watched from a video menu
- **THEN** the channel's badge count decreases by one promptly without a page reload

### Requirement: Mark Channel Watched From Channel View
A channel detail view SHALL provide an action to mark the channel watched, which asks for confirmation as described in "Confirm Bulk Mark Watched". The action SHALL sit among the page header's actions.

#### Scenario: Marking a channel watched from its view
- **WHEN** a user chooses the mark-watched action from a channel's page header and confirms
- **THEN** every downloaded video in the list shows a tick, and the channel's sidebar badge disappears

### Requirement: Video Actions Menu
Every video card on the home view and every row of a playlist or channel detail view's video list, the selected video's row included, SHALL show an always-visible vertical "⋮" control to the right of the video's title. Activating it SHALL open a menu with a "Mark as watched" item, without selecting or navigating to the video. Choosing the item SHALL mark the video watched without confirmation. The item SHALL be disabled when the video is already watched or has not finished downloading. When marking fails, the application SHALL tell the user and leave the video as it was. On a home card whose source is a playlist, the menu SHALL also offer an item labeled `Exclude "<playlist name>" from home`, which excludes that playlist from home without confirmation and refreshes the home view's sections; when it fails, the application SHALL tell the user and leave the playlist as it was. Home cards whose source is a channel and list rows SHALL NOT offer it. The video detail pane SHALL NOT show a "⋮" control; the selected video can also be marked watched from its "Mark watched" button, as described in "Video Detail Watched Control".

#### Scenario: Marking a video watched from a home card

#### Scenario: Marking the selected video watched from its detail pane
- **WHEN** a user activates "Mark watched" in the video detail pane
- **THEN** the selected video is watched and its row in the list shows a tick

#### Scenario: The selected row leaves the menu to the detail pane
- **WHEN** a video is selected in a playlist or channel detail view
- **THEN** its row in the list shows a "⋮" control like every other row, and the detail pane shows none

#### Scenario: Opening the menu doesn't navigate
- **WHEN** a user opens the menu on a home card or a list row
- **THEN** the application neither navigates nor changes the selected video

#### Scenario: Already watched video
- **WHEN** a user opens the menu of a watched video
- **THEN** "Mark as watched" is shown disabled

#### Scenario: Video not downloaded yet
- **WHEN** a user opens the menu of a video that is pending, downloading or errored

- **THEN** the menu offers "Mark as watched" only

#### Scenario: List rows and the detail pane have no exclude item
- **WHEN** a user opens the menu of a row in a playlist's video list
- **THEN** the menu offers "Mark as watched" only, and the video detail pane offers no menu at all

### Requirement: Video Detail Watched Control
The video detail pane's title row SHALL show, to the right of the title and before the playback speed control, a "Mark watched" button for the selected video while it is downloaded and unwatched, which marks the video watched without confirmation. At or above the desktop breakpoint the button SHALL show a tick and the label "Mark watched"; below it, only the tick, keeping "Mark watched" as its accessible name. The button SHALL NOT be shown once the video is watched or while it has not finished downloading; a watched video is shown as such on the meta line, as described in "Video Detail Meta Line".

#### Scenario: Marking the selected video watched
- **WHEN** a user activates "Mark watched" in the detail pane of a downloaded, unwatched video
- **THEN** the selected video is watched, its row in the list shows a tick, the button disappears and the meta line starts with "Watched"

#### Scenario: Watched video
- **WHEN** a user selects a watched video
- **THEN** the detail pane shows no "Mark watched" button and its meta line starts with "Watched"

#### Scenario: Rewatching resets the control
- **WHEN** a user replays a watched video past 10% of its duration

### Requirement: Playback Speed Control
The title row of a playlist or channel detail view's video detail pane SHALL show a playback speed control to the right of the title, labelled with the current playback speed (e.g. "1x", "1.5x"). Activating it SHALL open a menu offering the speeds 1x, 1.1x, 1.25x, 1.5x and 2x, with the current speed marked. Choosing a speed SHALL change the playing video's speed immediately without interrupting playback. The speed SHALL apply only to the selected video: selecting another video, or reloading the application, SHALL start playback at 1x. When the speed is changed through the browser's own player controls, the control SHALL show that speed, even when it is not one of the offered speeds. The control SHALL be disabled while the selected video has not finished downloading.

#### Scenario: Choosing a faster speed
- **WHEN** a user opens the speed control of a downloaded video and chooses "1.5x"
- **THEN** the video plays at 1.5 times normal speed and the control reads "1.5x"

#### Scenario: Default speed
- **WHEN** a user selects a downloaded video
- **THEN** the speed control reads "1x" and the video plays at normal speed

#### Scenario: Speed resets when another video is selected
- **WHEN** a user plays a video at 2x and then selects another video

### Requirement: Video Detail Title Prominence
In the video detail pane, the video's title SHALL occupy its own row, taking all of its width except what the channel avatar (to its left, in a channel detail view) and the video's actions (to its right: the "Mark watched" button when shown, the playback speed control and the "Open video on YouTube" link) need. No other elements SHALL share that row at any viewport size.

#### Scenario: Long title on a mobile viewport
- **WHEN** a user on a mobile-width viewport selects a video with a long title
- **THEN** the title wraps across the width of the detail pane left by the video's actions, and the meta line appears below it

### Requirement: Video Detail Status And Location
The video detail pane SHALL always show, below the meta line, the video's storage location and, when the video is not downloaded, a status indicator, at every viewport size and with no control to expand or collapse them. The storage location SHALL be the folder holding the video's file, never the file name itself, so episode codes do not appear in the UI. The pane SHALL NOT show a quality indicator, a status indicator for a downloaded video, or the video's YouTube description.

#### Scenario: Details on a mobile viewport
- **WHEN** a user on a mobile-width viewport opens a playlist or channel detail view
- **THEN** the detail pane shows the video's title, its meta line and its storage location, with no "More" or "Less" control

- **WHEN** a user selects a video that is pending, downloading, retrying or errored
- **THEN** a status indicator shows that state, and no quality indicator is shown

### Requirement: Video Detail Meta Line
The video detail pane SHALL show a meta line directly below the title. The line SHALL read `Watched · <channel name> · Published <date> · Synced <relative time>`:
- "Watched" SHALL appear only when the video is watched.
- The channel name SHALL appear only in a playlist detail view.
- The publish time SHALL be shown as a date, without a time of day.
- The sync time SHALL be shown relative to now (for example "2d ago"), and its full date and time SHALL be available on hover. It SHALL be shown only at or above the desktop breakpoint.

#### Scenario: Video without metadata or sync time
- **WHEN** a user selects a pending video that has neither generated metadata nor a sync time
- **THEN** no meta line is shown

### Requirement: Compact Mobile Player
On viewports narrower than the desktop breakpoint, the video player area SHALL be sized to the video's own aspect ratio, with no blank padding above or below the video. The player SHALL start one standard page gutter below the detail view's page header. While the page scrolls, the page header SHALL scroll away and the player SHALL stay pinned directly below the application header.

#### Scenario: Downloaded video on a mobile viewport
- **WHEN** a user on a mobile-width viewport views a downloaded 16:9 video in a detail view
- **THEN** the player area is exactly as tall as the video at full width, and it starts one page gutter below the detail view's page header

#### Scenario: Scrolling past the page header on a mobile viewport
- **WHEN** a user on a mobile-width viewport scrolls down a detail view
- **THEN** the page header scrolls out of view and the player stays pinned directly below the application header

#### Scenario: Video not downloaded on a mobile viewport
- **WHEN** a user on a mobile-width viewport selects a video that has not been downloaded
- **THEN** the placeholder message appears in an area with the same 16:9 proportions as the player

### Requirement: Application Icon And Web App Manifest
The application SHALL serve its own Yarrtube icon as the browser favicon and as the home screen icon on iOS, instead of the default template icon. It SHALL declare a theme color that matches the header background. It SHALL serve a web app manifest so that, when added to a phone's home screen, it opens in standalone mode without the browser's toolbars.

### Requirement: Detail View Page Header
A playlist or channel detail view SHALL open with a page header showing the playlist's or channel's name, with the channel's avatar beside it for channels. Below the name it SHALL show a summary of the number of videos and, when above 0, the number of unwatched videos, also for a playlist whose count is hidden. The header SHALL offer, in this order, a sync (reconcile) action; for both, an action to mark the entry watched; for playlists an action labeled "Exclude from home" when the playlist is shown on home or "Include in home" when it is excluded, which changes that setting without confirmation, and the hide or show unwatched count action; for both, an "Edit settings" action that opens the edit channel or playlist dialog; for channels a link labeled "Open channel on YouTube" and for playlists a link labeled "Open playlist on YouTube", which opens the channel's or playlist's page on youtube.com in a new tab; and last, an action to delete the entry. At or above the desktop breakpoint every action but mark-watched and delete SHALL be a square icon-only button whose accessible name and tooltip are the action's label, followed by a vertical "⋮" control, named "More actions for <name>", whose menu offers the mark-watched action, labeled "Mark all watched", and, set apart, delete, styled as destructive. Below the desktop breakpoint the header SHALL show only that "⋮" control, always visible, whose menu offers every action, sync included, with delete set apart from the others. Deleting SHALL require confirmation and, once confirmed, SHALL return the user to the home view.

### Requirement: Remembered Sidebar Fold State
The application SHALL remember, per browser, whether each sidebar section is folded, and SHALL restore that state when the application is loaded again. When no state has been remembered, a section SHALL start unfolded. When the remembered state cannot be read, the section SHALL start unfolded without an error.

#### Scenario: Folded section survives a reload
- **WHEN** a user folds the Playlists section and reloads the page
- **THEN** the Playlists section is still folded, and the Channels section keeps its own fold state

### Requirement: Tasks View Describes Thumbnail Fetches
The tasks view SHALL describe a thumbnail fetch task in plain language,
naming the video whose thumbnail is being fetched and the playlist or
channel it belongs to, the same way it describes a video download task.

#### Scenario: Thumbnail fetch task with resolvable context
- **WHEN** the tasks view lists a thumbnail fetch task whose video title and playlist or channel name were resolved
- **THEN** the task is described as fetching the thumbnail of that video in that playlist or channel

#### Scenario: Thumbnail fetch task whose video can no longer be found
- **WHEN** the tasks view lists a thumbnail fetch task whose video title could not be resolved
- **THEN** the task is still described as a thumbnail fetch, using a generic placeholder in place of the missing names

### Requirement: Tasks View Search
The tasks view SHALL show a search field above the currently selected tab's list when that tab lists more than 15 tasks, and SHALL NOT show it otherwise. While the field contains text, the current tab SHALL list only the tasks whose plain-language description contains that text, ignoring case, keeping the tab's usual order. When no task in the current tab matches, the view SHALL say that nothing matches. Clearing the field SHALL restore the tab's full list.

Each task family SHALL be described in human terms, including playlist, channel, video, and Plex collection syncs, video downloads and thumbnail and subtitle fetches, file and container deletions, and the yt-dlp self-update. When a name the description would include could not be resolved, the description SHALL use a generic placeholder in its place rather than omitting the description.

#### Scenario: Plex collection sync is described in plain language
- **WHEN** the tasks view lists a Plex collection reconciliation task
- **THEN** it is described in plain language and not by its raw type identifier

#### Scenario: yt-dlp self-update is described in plain language
- **WHEN** the tasks view lists a yt-dlp self-update task
- **THEN** it is described in plain language and not by its raw type identifier

#### Scenario: No raw type identifier is ever shown

- **THEN** it is described as syncing that video in that playlist or channel, and not by its raw type identifier

### Requirement: Tasks View Shows Last Error
When a task the tasks view lists has a recorded last error, the view SHALL show that error on the task's row, so a user can see why a task is being retried. A task with no recorded last error SHALL show none.

#### Scenario: Retrying task shows its last error
- **WHEN** the tasks view lists a task that has been retried and has a recorded last error
- **THEN** the task's row shows that error text

The **AI** tab SHALL show only while AI is enabled in the preferences, and SHALL NOT show while preferences are loading or failed to load. Each tab SHALL show, beside its name, a count of the tasks it currently contains. A task belongs to a tab as follows:

- **Active**: every task whose status is `running`, regardless of its type.
- **Downloads**: video download and thumbnail fetch tasks.
- **Syncs**: playlist reconciliation, channel reconciliation and video sync tasks.
- **AI**: video summary tasks, while the **AI** tab shows.
- **Other**: every task that belongs to none of Downloads, Syncs or a shown AI tab, including Plex collection reconciliation, the yt-dlp self-update, deletion of a video file or of a playlist's or channel's files, and any task type the view does not otherwise recognise.

Every task SHALL appear in exactly one of Downloads, Syncs, AI, or Other, and additionally in **Active** while it is running. The view SHALL open on the **Active** tab. Each tab SHALL list its tasks in the view's usual order (running first, then tasks already due, then tasks scheduled for later). Each task row SHALL show an icon that reflects the kind of work the task does (download, sync, deletion, AI, or maintenance), so rows of different kinds within **Other** remain distinguishable.

#### Scenario: View opens on the Active tab
- **WHEN** a user opens the tasks view
- **THEN** the Active tab is selected and lists only the tasks whose status is `running`

#### Scenario: Running task appears under Active regardless of type

- **THEN** the Other tab lists all of them and no download or playlist/channel sync tasks

#### Scenario: Counts match listed tasks
- **WHEN** tasks of several families are present
- **THEN** each tab's count matches the number of tasks it lists, and the counts of every tab but Active add up to the total number of tasks

#### Scenario: No Cleanup or All tab
- **WHEN** a user opens the tasks view
- **THEN** no Cleanup tab and no All tab are offered

#### Scenario: Active tab is empty
- **WHEN** no task is running
- **THEN** the Active tab shows a message that nothing is running rather than an empty area, and the other tabs still list their tasks

#### Scenario: AI tab lists video summaries
- **WHEN** AI is enabled and the tasks include video summaries
- **THEN** the AI tab shows between Syncs and Other and lists them, and the Other tab doesn't

#### Scenario: AI tab with no tasks
- **WHEN** AI is enabled and no video summary is queued
- **THEN** the AI tab shows with a count of 0

#### Scenario: AI turned off with summaries still queued
- **WHEN** AI is off and the tasks include video summaries
- **THEN** no AI tab shows and the Other tab lists them

#### Scenario: Preferences not loaded
- **WHEN** preferences are loading or failed to load
- **THEN** no AI tab shows and the Other tab lists any video summaries

### Requirement: Tasks View Tab Bar Affordance
The tasks view's tab bar SHALL make each tab look clickable and SHALL make the selected tab unmistakable. The tasks view SHALL be limited to a readable width and aligned to the left edge of the content area, like the other views, and the tab bar SHALL span exactly the width of the task list, its tabs sharing that width equally. The tab bar SHALL be drawn as a row of tabs over a horizontal rule, with the selected tab marked by an underline in the application's primary colour and its label in the full foreground colour and a heavier weight; unselected tabs SHALL show a muted label. Hovering an unselected tab SHALL visibly change its background and label colour. Each tab SHALL show an icon for its family, its name, and its count as a pill, with the selected tab's pill in the primary colour. On narrow screens each tab SHALL show only its icon and count, keeping its name as its accessible name, so that all tabs fit without horizontal scrolling. While at least one task is running, the **Active** tab SHALL show a live indicator beside its count. Each tab SHALL be at least 40 pixels tall and SHALL show a visible focus ring when focused from the keyboard. The tab bar SHALL look the same whatever the operating system's colour-scheme preference.

#### Scenario: Selected tab is marked
- **WHEN** a user views the tasks view with the Syncs tab selected
- **THEN** the Syncs tab shows the primary-coloured underline, a full-colour heavier label, and a primary-coloured count pill, and no other tab does

#### Scenario: Hovering an unselected tab

#### Scenario: Wide screen
- **WHEN** the tasks view is shown on a wide desktop screen
- **THEN** the view is left-aligned at a readable width, its left edge matching the other views' content, and the tab bar's rule and the task list share the same left and right edges

#### Scenario: Narrow screen
- **WHEN** the tasks view is shown on a phone-width screen
- **THEN** every tab shows its icon and count without its visible name, all four tabs are visible without scrolling, and each tab is still announced by its name to assistive technology

### Requirement: Run Sync Now From Tasks View
Each playlist or channel reconciliation task listed in the **Syncs** tab SHALL offer a **Run now** action. Activating it SHALL trigger the on-demand reconcile of that task's playlist or channel — the same action the sidebar's sync offers — and SHALL leave the listed task itself and its scheduled run time unchanged. While the triggered reconcile is in progress, that row's action SHALL show that it is working and SHALL NOT accept another activation. When the reconcile completes, the tasks view SHALL refresh its list. When the reconcile fails, the view SHALL show the failure on that row without removing it. A reconciliation task whose status is `running` SHALL NOT offer Run now, since its sync is already underway. Tasks in other tabs SHALL NOT offer this action.

#### Scenario: Running a playlist sync now
- **WHEN** a user activates Run now on a playlist reconciliation task in the Syncs tab
- **THEN** the application triggers a reconcile of that playlist, and the task remains listed with its scheduled run time unchanged

#### Scenario: Running a channel sync now
- **WHEN** a user activates Run now on a channel reconciliation task in the Syncs tab
- **THEN** the application triggers a reconcile of that channel

#### Scenario: Run now while in progress

- **WHEN** a triggered reconcile completes successfully
- **THEN** the tasks view refreshes its list of tasks

#### Scenario: Run now fails
- **WHEN** a triggered reconcile fails
- **THEN** the view shows that the sync failed, and the row's action can be activated again

#### Scenario: No Run now on a running sync
- **WHEN** the Syncs tab lists a reconciliation task whose status is `running`
- **THEN** that row offers no Run now action

#### Scenario: No Run now outside Syncs
- **WHEN** a user views the Downloads, Other, or Active tab
- **THEN** no task row offers a Run now action

### Requirement: Edit Channel Dialog
The edit channel dialog SHALL be titled "Edit <channel name> settings" and show the "Video quality" control, a "Video limit" field (whole numbers from 1 to 1000) and the "Check for new videos every" field, prefilled with the channel's current values. Saving SHALL send only the changed settings, close the dialog and refresh the library. When the video limit changed, saving SHALL also trigger a sync of the channel; a changed quality or interval alone SHALL NOT. Cancelling or saving with nothing changed SHALL send nothing.

#### Scenario: Dialog prefilled with current settings
- **WHEN** a user chooses "Edit settings" for a channel named "Veritasium" with quality `mid`, video limit 5 and an interval of 180 minutes
- **THEN** the "Edit Veritasium settings" dialog opens with "Video quality" set to Mid, "Video limit" set to 5 and the interval showing 3 hours

#### Scenario: Sync after saving fails
- **WHEN** a user saves a new video limit and the sync it triggers fails
- **THEN** the application tells the user the sync failed, and the new settings stay saved

#### Scenario: Saving with nothing changed
- **WHEN** a user saves without changing any setting
- **THEN** the application sends no request and closes the dialog

#### Scenario: Invalid video limit
- **WHEN** a user enters a video limit below 1 or above 1000
- **THEN** the dialog flags the field as invalid and does not send the request

#### Scenario: Save fails
- **WHEN** saving the settings fails
- **THEN** the dialog stays open, shows the error, and the channel keeps its previous settings

### Requirement: Lowering The Video Limit Warns About Deletion

- **THEN** no quality note is shown

### Requirement: Reconcile Interval Field
Wherever the application lets the user set how often a channel or playlist is checked, it SHALL show a field labeled "Check for new videos every" made of a whole-number input and a unit selector offering "minutes" and "hours". The value sent SHALL be the entered number converted to minutes. When showing a stored interval, the field SHALL use hours when the interval is a whole number of hours, and minutes otherwise. An entry that is empty, not a whole number, below 1 minute or above 24 hours SHALL be flagged as invalid, and the form SHALL NOT be submitted.

#### Scenario: Interval shown in hours
- **WHEN** the field shows a stored interval of 180 minutes
- **THEN** it shows 3 with the unit "hours"

#### Scenario: Interval shown in minutes
- **WHEN** the field shows a stored interval of 90 minutes

- **THEN** the dialog stays open and says the name is already taken

### Requirement: Category View
Each category SHALL have a view at an address of its own with a header and its videos as a grid of the same cards as the home view, each YouTube video once, newest sync first. Activating a card SHALL open the video within the category, as described in "Category Playback", instead of in its channel's or playlist's view. The header SHALL be tinted with the soft tint of the category's color and SHALL show the category's name, a summary of its number of sources, its number of videos and, when above 0, its number of unwatched videos, and the same actions layout as the channel and playlist views' page header, offering "Change color", which opens the category color picker and saves the chosen color immediately, "Edit settings", which opens the category settings dialog, "Mark all watched" (only when the category has sources), which marks every downloaded video of the category watched after the confirmation described in "Confirm Bulk Mark Watched", and "Delete", which deletes the category after the same confirmation as the sidebar row's "Delete" and then navigates to the home view; at or above the desktop breakpoint "Delete" SHALL be in the "More actions" menu as on the channel and playlist views. When the category is known from the categories list, the header SHALL show its name and tint at once, before its videos load, with a placeholder in place of the summary; the videos SHALL show as placeholders as described in "Loading Placeholders" until they load. A category with no sources SHALL say so and offer a control that opens the category settings dialog. A category with sources but without downloaded videos SHALL say it has no videos yet. When the category does not exist, the view SHALL say it was not found.

#### Scenario: Category videos
- **WHEN** a user opens the "Chess" view, which holds 2 sources with 14 downloaded videos, 3 of them unwatched
- **THEN** the view shows "Chess", the summary "2 sources · 14 videos · 3 unwatched", and the videos as cards, newest sync first

#### Scenario: Card opens the video in the category

- **THEN** the application stays on the "Chess" view and plays that video, as described in "Category Playback"

#### Scenario: Header tinted
- **WHEN** a user opens the "Chess" view and "Chess" is colored "#0ea5e9"
- **THEN** the header's background is the soft tint of that color's hue

#### Scenario: Header while loading
- **WHEN** a user opens the "Chess" view from the sidebar and its videos are still loading
- **THEN** the header already shows "Chess" with its tint and actions, a placeholder in place of the summary, and placeholder cards below

#### Scenario: Changing the color
- **WHEN** a user activates "Change color" on the "Chess" view and chooses "Violet"
- **THEN** "Chess" is saved with the color "#8b5cf6", and the header, the sidebar dot and the home chips of its videos show it

#### Scenario: Mark all watched

- **THEN** the category is deleted and the application navigates to the home view

#### Scenario: Empty category
- **WHEN** a user opens a category with no sources
- **THEN** the view says it holds no channels or playlists yet and offers a control that opens the category settings dialog

#### Scenario: Unknown category
- **WHEN** a user opens the view of a category that does not exist
- **THEN** the view says the category was not found

### Requirement: Category Playback
A category view SHALL play its videos like a playlist view. Activating a card on the category view SHALL open that video within the category, at an address that identifies both the category and the video, with the video selected and autoplaying as for a deep-linked video. In this mode the view SHALL keep the category's header and SHALL show the player and the selected video's detail, the same as a channel or playlist view. The category's videos, in the order of the category's grid, SHALL be the video list beside them. Selecting a video in that list SHALL play it without leaving the category. Each video SHALL play from, offer the subtitles of, and record its watch progress against the channel or playlist the category lists it from. A video listed from a channel SHALL show that channel's avatar in its detail, linking to the channel. Opening the category without a video, for example from the sidebar, SHALL show the grid.

#### Scenario: Opening a card plays it in the category
- **WHEN** a user activates the card of the video "Rook endings", listed from the playlist "Endgames", on the "Chess" view
- **THEN** the address identifies the "Chess" category and "Rook endings", the player autoplays "Rook endings" from the playlist "Endgames", and the list beside it shows the videos of "Chess"

#### Scenario: Queue switches across sources
- **WHEN** a user playing "Rook endings" in the "Chess" view selects "Blitz", listed from the channel "Hikaru", in the list beside the player
- **THEN** the player plays "Blitz" from the channel "Hikaru", the view stays on "Chess", and the detail shows Hikaru's avatar linking to the channel

#### Scenario: Progress recorded against the source
- **WHEN** a user watches a video in a category view past the watched threshold
- **THEN** the video is watched in its channel or playlist and in the category, and the badges update as when watched from its source's view

#### Scenario: Back to the grid
- **WHEN** a user playing a video in the "Chess" view activates "Chess" in the sidebar
- **THEN** the view shows the grid of the category's videos

### Requirement: Rename Category In Place
The category view's name SHALL be shown as a heading, not as a field, next to an icon control with the accessible name and tooltip "Rename". Activating it SHALL replace the heading with a field holding the name, focused and selected. Pressing Enter or moving focus away SHALL save the name; pressing Escape SHALL cancel and show the saved name. A blank name or a name another category already has SHALL be rejected with a message, keeping the field open with the typed name until the user saves a valid name or cancels. An unchanged name SHALL close the field without saving.

#### Scenario: Renaming
- **WHEN** a user activates "Rename" on the "Chess" view, types "Board games" and presses Enter
- **THEN** the heading shows "Board games" and so does the sidebar row

#### Scenario: Cancelling a rename
- **WHEN** a user activates "Rename", changes the name and presses Escape
- **THEN** the heading shows the saved name and nothing is saved

#### Scenario: Rename rejected
- **WHEN** a user renames "Chess" to the name of another category
- **THEN** the view says the name is already taken and the category keeps its saved name

### Requirement: Category Settings Dialog
The category settings dialog SHALL be titled "Edit <name> settings" and SHALL show every tracked channel and playlist as a chip, channels under a "Channels" group and playlists under a "Playlists" group, each group ordered by name ignoring case. Channel chips SHALL show the channel's avatar; playlist chips a playlist icon. Each chip SHALL be a toggle whose pressed state means the source is in the category, shown with a check mark and a tinted fill, while a source not in it is shown outlined with a plus mark. Toggling a chip SHALL NOT change the order of the chips. A search field, focused when the dialog opens, SHALL filter the chips by name ignoring case, and pressing Enter in it while exactly one chip matches SHALL toggle that chip. Filter controls "All", "In <name>" and "Not in <name>", the last two showing how many sources they hold, SHALL narrow the chips by state. A group with no chip left to show SHALL be hidden. While AI, categories and categorization are all on, the dialog SHALL show, above the search field, an "AI prompt" multi-line text field prefilled with the category's AI prompt and described by the hint "Describe the videos that belong in this category."; otherwise it SHALL NOT show, and the saved prompt SHALL be kept. Toggling a chip or editing the prompt SHALL only stage changes: the dialog SHALL summarise the sources staged (such as "+2 added, −1 removed"), its "Save" control SHALL be disabled until something is staged, and saving SHALL send only what changed, making the category's AI prompt the text in the field (blank removes it) and its sources exactly the pressed chips, then close the dialog. The AI prompt SHALL be sent only while its field shows and differs from what it started from, so a prompt changed elsewhere while the dialog is open is neither staged nor overwritten. The dialog SHALL set no length limit of its own: a prompt the daemon rejects SHALL show the daemon's message and keep the text. When saving fails, the dialog SHALL stay open, keep the staged changes and say why. When the prompt is saved but the sources fail, the error SHALL read "The AI prompt was saved, but the sources weren't: <reason>", saving again SHALL send only the sources, and discarding SHALL say "The AI prompt is already saved. Your changes to the sources in <name> won't be saved." Cancelling or dismissing the dialog with staged changes SHALL ask to discard them first. With no channel or playlist tracked, the dialog SHALL say so. Chips SHALL be reachable with the arrow keys within a group. On viewports narrower than the desktop breakpoint the dialog SHALL fill the screen; the search, the filter controls and the save controls SHALL stay visible while the AI prompt and the chips scroll together. At every viewport size the save controls SHALL stay visible, and the AI prompt field SHALL NOT be resizable.

#### Scenario: Chips show membership
- **WHEN** a user opens the dialog of "Chess", which holds the channel "Hikaru", and "GothamChess" and the playlist "Endgame course" are also tracked
- **THEN** "Channels" shows "GothamChess" unpressed and "Hikaru" pressed, and "Playlists" shows "Endgame course" unpressed

#### Scenario: Staging and saving
- **WHEN** a user presses "GothamChess" and "Endgame course", unpresses "Hikaru" and saves
- **THEN** the summary read "+2 added, −1 removed" before saving, and afterwards "Chess" holds exactly "GothamChess" and "Endgame course"

#### Scenario: Order stays put
- **WHEN** a user toggles a chip
- **THEN** every chip keeps its place

#### Scenario: Searching
- **WHEN** a user types "ver" in the search field
- **THEN** only chips whose name contains "ver", ignoring case, are shown

#### Scenario: Enter toggles the only match
- **WHEN** the search leaves exactly one chip and the user presses Enter
- **THEN** that chip is toggled and the search field keeps focus

#### Scenario: Filtering by state
- **WHEN** a user chooses "In Chess"
- **THEN** only pressed chips are shown, staged ones included

#### Scenario: Nothing to save
- **WHEN** no chip has been toggled, or every toggle has been undone
- **THEN** "Save" is disabled

#### Scenario: AI prompt shown
- **WHEN** AI, categories and categorization are on and a user opens the dialog of "Chess", whose AI prompt is "Chess games"
- **THEN** "AI prompt" holds "Chess games"

#### Scenario: AI prompt hidden
- **WHEN** AI or categorization is off and a user opens the dialog of "Chess"
- **THEN** there is no "AI prompt" field and saving sources leaves its AI prompt as it was

#### Scenario: Saving only the prompt
- **WHEN** a user changes "AI prompt" without toggling a chip and saves
- **THEN** only the category's `ai_prompt` is sent, its members are not, and the dialog closes

#### Scenario: Saving the prompt and sources
- **WHEN** a user changes "AI prompt", presses a chip and saves
- **THEN** both the prompt and the members are saved and the dialog closes

#### Scenario: Removing the prompt
- **WHEN** a user empties "AI prompt" of a category that has one and saves
- **THEN** the category has no AI prompt

#### Scenario: Prompt changed elsewhere
- **WHEN** the dialog of "Chess" is open, its AI prompt changes elsewhere and the user saves only a chip change
- **THEN** only the members are sent and the prompt saved elsewhere is kept

#### Scenario: Prompt too long
- **WHEN** a user pastes 2500 characters into "AI prompt" and saves
- **THEN** all 2500 are sent, and the dialog stays open with the text and shows the daemon's message

#### Scenario: Prompt saved but sources failed
- **WHEN** a user changes "AI prompt", presses a chip and saves, and only the sources fail
- **THEN** the dialog says "The AI prompt was saved, but the sources weren't: <reason>", and saving again sends only the members

#### Scenario: Discarding after the prompt was saved
- **WHEN** the prompt was saved, the sources failed and the user cancels
- **THEN** the dialog asks to discard, saying "The AI prompt is already saved. Your changes to the sources in Chess won't be saved."

#### Scenario: Discarding staged changes
- **WHEN** a user with staged changes cancels the dialog
- **THEN** the user is asked to discard them, and confirming closes the dialog without saving

#### Scenario: Save fails
- **WHEN** saving fails
- **THEN** the dialog stays open with the staged changes and says why

#### Scenario: Nothing tracked
- **WHEN** a user opens the dialog with no channel or playlist tracked
- **THEN** the dialog says there are no channels or playlists to add yet

### Requirement: Categories Field In Add And Edit Dialogs
The add channel, add playlist, edit channel and edit playlist dialogs SHALL offer a "Categories" field showing every existing category as a toggle chip, ordered by name ignoring case. A chip's pressed state SHALL mean the source is chosen for that category. A chosen chip SHALL be filled with the soft tint of its category's hue, show its name in the dark shade of that hue, as the home card chips do, and show a check mark. A chip not chosen SHALL be outlined and show a dot in its category's color. Toggling a chip SHALL NOT change the order of the chips. The field SHALL also offer a "New category" text field with an "Add" control. Adding the typed name SHALL create a category with that name at once and choose it, or, when a category already has that name ignoring case, SHALL choose that category without creating one. Pressing Enter in the "New category" field SHALL add the typed name and SHALL NOT submit the dialog. Saving an add dialog SHALL track the source and then make it a member of exactly the chosen categories. Saving an edit dialog SHALL make the source a member of exactly the chosen categories, and a change of categories alone SHALL count as a change to save. When the source is saved but its categories cannot be, the dialog SHALL say so and keep the source saved.

#### Scenario: Every category shown
- **WHEN** a user opens the add channel dialog and the categories "Streams", "Chess" and "Science" exist
- **THEN** the Categories field shows the chips "Chess", "Science" and "Streams", none pressed, without typing anything

#### Scenario: Chosen chips in their category's color

- **THEN** the category "Speedcubing" exists and its chip is shown pressed

#### Scenario: Typing an existing name
- **WHEN** a user types "chess" in "New category" and presses Enter while "Chess" exists
- **THEN** the "Chess" chip is pressed, no category is created and the dialog is not submitted

#### Scenario: Editing a source's categories
- **WHEN** a user unpresses the "Chess" chip in a channel's edit dialog and saves
- **THEN** the channel is no longer a member of "Chess" and stays in its other categories

#### Scenario: Categories are the only change
- **WHEN** a user changes only the Categories field in an edit dialog
- **THEN** the dialog can be saved and saving updates the categories

#### Scenario: Categories fail to save
- **WHEN** a user adds a channel with categories chosen and the channel is tracked but its categories cannot be saved
- **THEN** the dialog says the channel was added but its categories were not saved

### Requirement: Unwatched Badge On Sidebar Playlists
Each playlist row in the sidebar SHALL display a badge with the playlist's unwatched video count when that count is above 0 and not hidden, and no badge otherwise. After an action in the application that changes a playlist's unwatched count or its hide setting, the badge and the playlist's sidebar position SHALL update promptly, without waiting for the periodic refresh. The same actions as for channel badges apply, plus marking the playlist watched and hiding or showing its count.

- **THEN** it offers neither "Exclude from home" nor "Include in home"

### Requirement: Edit Dialogs Show The Location
The edit playlist and edit channel dialogs SHALL show a "Location" line with the source's current storage path and a "Move…" control next to it. Activating "Move…" SHALL close the edit dialog without saving and open the move dialog for that source.

#### Scenario: Location shown
- **WHEN** a user opens the edit dialog of a playlist stored at `music/chill`
- **THEN** the dialog shows "Location" with `music/chill` and a "Move…" control

#### Scenario: Move unavailable while work is in progress

#### Scenario: Unchanged destination
- **WHEN** the destination equals the source's current path
- **THEN** the save control is disabled

#### Scenario: Folder name `.` or `..`
- **WHEN** a user names the folder `.` or `..`, or creates a new folder with either name in the folder browser

- **THEN** no request is sent

### Requirement: Watch Progress On Video Thumbnails
Every video thumbnail in the playlist detail, channel detail, category and home views SHALL show the video as in progress when it is unwatched, its saved playback position is greater than 0 and its duration is known. An in-progress thumbnail SHALL show a progress bar along its bottom edge, proportional to the saved position over the duration, and SHALL show the time left instead of the video's duration. The time left is the duration minus the saved position: below one minute it SHALL read `<1m left`; below one hour, `<minutes>m left` with the minutes rounded down; from one hour, `<hours>h <minutes>m left`, or `<hours>h left` when the minutes are 0. The duration badge and the watched tick SHALL NOT overlap the progress bar. A thumbnail that is not in progress SHALL show no progress bar and SHALL show the video's duration as before.

### Requirement: Confirm Bulk Mark Watched
Marking a channel, playlist or category watched, from its page header or its sidebar row menu, SHALL first ask the user to confirm when it has 2 or more unwatched videos, counting them also when its count is hidden. The confirmation SHALL state how many videos will be marked and that this cannot be undone in bulk, with a destructive-styled confirm action. Cancelling SHALL mark nothing. With 0 or 1 unwatched videos, it SHALL take effect without confirmation.

#### Scenario: Confirming marks the entry watched

#### Scenario: Search without categories
- **WHEN** categories are off, "Chess" exists and a user types "chess" in the header search
- **THEN** the search shows no Categories group

#### Scenario: Preferences fail to load

- **THEN** the home videos are reloaded straight away

### Requirement: Video Card Presentation
Video cards on the home view and on a category's view SHALL be drawn without a frame and without a background: the thumbnail and the text below it sit directly on the page background, with no border and no padding around the card. Hovering a card with a pointer SHALL show a soft background behind the whole card and slightly enlarge the thumbnail within its rounded bounds. Below the title, a card SHALL show a meta line:
- **Channel video:** the channel's avatar beside the title, and on the meta line the channel's name followed by " · " and how long ago the video was published.
- **Playlist video:** a placeholder playlist icon in the avatar's place, and on the meta line the playlist's name followed by " · " and how long ago the video was published.
- **No publish date:** the meta line shows only the source's name.

The relative date SHALL read as a short age ("3h ago", "2d ago", "5w ago", "4mo ago", "2y ago").

Activating a card anywhere SHALL open its video, except on the card's own controls: the channel's avatar and the playlist icon lead to the source's view, as does the source's name on the meta line, and the actions menu control opens the menu. Category chips are labels, not controls: activating one opens the video like the rest of the card. Each card SHALL offer a single link to its video, so keyboard users move through cards one stop per video plus the source and menu controls.

#### Scenario: Frameless card
- **WHEN** a user views the home view
- **THEN** no video card has a border, padding or background colour of its own

#### Scenario: Hovering a card

#### Scenario: Unknown publish date
- **WHEN** a home card shows a channel video with no publish date
- **THEN** its meta line reads only the channel's name

#### Scenario: Activating the card's empty space
- **WHEN** a user clicks a card's padding or the empty end of its meta line
- **THEN** the application opens that card's video

#### Scenario: Activating the playlist icon
- **WHEN** a user activates the playlist icon on a card of the playlist "Chess Middlegames"
- **THEN** the application opens the "Chess Middlegames" view, not the video

### Requirement: Home Card Category Chips
On the home view's "Continue watching", "Quick watches" and "Latest videos" sections, each video card SHALL show the video's categories, in the order the video lists them, as small text chips below its meta line. Each chip SHALL show the category's name in a dark shade of the category's hue, over a soft tint of that hue. A card SHALL show at most 2 chips, followed by a "+N" chip when the video has more categories. A video in no category SHALL show no chip row. Cards in "More about <category>" sections and on a category's view SHALL NOT show chips.

#### Scenario: One category
- **WHEN** a video under "Latest videos" belongs to "Chess"
- **THEN** its card shows one chip reading "Chess", tinted with Chess's hue

#### Scenario: Many categories

- **THEN** no card in it shows a category chip

### Requirement: Home Shelves
At or above the small breakpoint, "Continue watching", each category section and "Quick watches" SHALL each show their videos in a single row whose number of columns follows the width available to the content area, not the viewport. A section SHALL show only as many videos as fit in that row and SHALL never leave a partial second row. "Latest videos" SHALL keep a multi-row grid whose rows are always complete except possibly the last. Below the small breakpoint, those same sections SHALL be horizontal rows the user can swipe, each card about three quarters of the content width so that the next card peeks in, snapping card by card.

#### Scenario: Wide desktop
- **WHEN** a category section has 6 videos and the content area fits 5 columns
- **THEN** the section shows 5 videos in one row and no second row

#### Scenario: Collapsed sidebar or narrower content
- **WHEN** the content area narrows so that only 3 columns fit

#### Scenario: Tapping a card's menu on a phone
- **WHEN** a user on a touch device taps near a card's "⋮" control
- **THEN** the video actions menu opens, from a hit area at least 44 by 44 pixels

### Requirement: Loading Placeholders
While a view's videos are loading, the application SHALL show placeholders shaped like the content they stand for (thumbnail blocks with title and meta lines, or list rows), animated subtly, instead of "Loading…" text. The loading region SHALL be marked busy for assistive technology and SHALL be announced as loading. This applies to the home view, a category's view, and a channel's or playlist's video list. Placeholders SHALL take the space of the content they stand for, so the layout does not shift when the content arrives. When the motion-reduction preference is set, placeholders SHALL NOT animate.

#### Scenario: Home while loading
- **WHEN** a user opens the home view and its videos are still loading
- **THEN** the view shows placeholder sections of placeholder cards, marked busy, and no section heading such as "Latest videos"

#### Scenario: Home after loading
- **WHEN** the home view's videos arrive
- **THEN** the placeholders are replaced by the real sections and nothing is marked busy

#### Scenario: Channel video list while loading
- **WHEN** a user opens a channel's view and its videos are still loading

### Requirement: Global Search
The header SHALL offer a search control named "Search" that opens a search dialog. The dialog SHALL also open with ⌘K on macOS and Ctrl+K elsewhere, from anywhere in the application except while another dialog is open. As the user types, the dialog SHALL show results grouped, in this order:
- **Categories**: names containing the text, ignoring case.
- **Channels**: names containing the text, ignoring case.
- **Playlists**: names containing the text, ignoring case.
- **Videos**: the matches the daemon returns for the text, as described in the `video-search` capability, each with its thumbnail, title and source name.

Name matches SHALL appear as the user types. Video results SHALL be requested only once the text has at least 2 characters and the user has paused typing briefly. A group with no matches SHALL be hidden. When no group has matches, the dialog SHALL say nothing matches the text. While videos are being searched, the Videos group SHALL show that it is searching. Results SHALL be navigable with the arrow keys and chosen with Enter or a click. Choosing a category, channel or playlist SHALL navigate to its view; choosing a video SHALL open it in its source's view. Choosing a result or pressing Escape SHALL close the dialog. On phone-width viewports the search control SHALL be an icon button in the header, and the dialog SHALL cover the screen.

#### Scenario: Opening with the keyboard
- **WHEN** a user presses ⌘K on macOS
- **THEN** the search dialog opens with its field focused

#### Scenario: Grouped matches
- **WHEN** a user types "chess" and the category "Chess", the channel "ChessCoach Andras" and videos titled "Chess Tactics: Spot the Trigger" exist
- **THEN** the dialog shows "Chess" under Categories, "ChessCoach Andras" under Channels and the matching videos under Videos, and no Playlists group

#### Scenario: Short text searches names only
- **WHEN** a user types a single character
- **THEN** the dialog shows matching categories, channels and playlists and requests no video search

#### Scenario: Choosing a video
- **WHEN** a user chooses a video result from the channel "BettaTech"
- **THEN** the dialog closes and the application opens that video in the "BettaTech" channel view

#### Scenario: Nothing matches
- **WHEN** a user types "zzz" and nothing matches

- **THEN** the Videos group says videos could not be searched, and the name matches are still shown

### Requirement: Sidebar Count Style
The unwatched counts on sidebar rows and on folded section headings SHALL be shown as muted, small, tabular numerals at the row's trailing edge, without a filled background, and in the full foreground colour on the active row.

#### Scenario: Count on a channel row
- **WHEN** a channel row shows an unwatched count of 3
- **THEN** the count "3" is shown as a muted numeral without a filled pill behind it

### Requirement: Tasks View Describes Quality Checks
The tasks view SHALL describe a quality check task in plain language, naming the video whose quality is being checked and the playlist or channel it belongs to, and SHALL list it with the download tasks, the same way it describes and lists a chapters fetch task.

#### Scenario: Quality check task with resolvable context
- **WHEN** the tasks view lists a quality check task whose video title and playlist or channel name were resolved
- **THEN** the task is described as checking the quality of that video in that playlist or channel, under the downloads tab

#### Scenario: Quality check task whose video can no longer be found
- **WHEN** the tasks view lists a quality check task whose video title could not be resolved
- **THEN** the task is still described as a quality check, using a generic placeholder in place of the missing names

### Requirement: Summarize Videos Checkbox
The add and edit dialogs for channels and playlists SHALL show a "Summarize videos" checkbox described by the hint "Generate and show an AI summary of each video.". It SHALL sit in the "AI" section of the dialog. In add dialogs it SHALL be always visible (not in "Advanced options"), unchecked by default, sent as `summaries_enabled`. Edit dialogs SHALL prefill it and send `summaries_enabled` only when changed.

#### Scenario: Visible without advanced options
