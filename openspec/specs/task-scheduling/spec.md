# task-scheduling Specification

## Purpose

Provides a persisted, restart-safe mechanism for scheduling work to run at or after a specific time and executing it through exactly one handler per task, so scheduled and recurring work survives process restarts.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Scheduling a Task
The system SHALL allow a task to be scheduled with a type, a payload, and a time at or after which it becomes eligible to run.

#### Scenario: Task scheduled for now
- **WHEN** a task is scheduled with a run time at or before the current time
- **THEN** it is immediately eligible to run

#### Scenario: Task scheduled for a future time
- **WHEN** a task is scheduled with a run time in the future
- **THEN** it does not become eligible to run until that time has passed

### Requirement: Single Execution Per Attempt
The system SHALL poll for eligible tasks in the background and dispatch each one to exactly one handler based on its type. A task SHALL be dispatched at most once per attempt, even when several tasks run at the same time. Every task type SHALL belong to exactly one lane (see "Task Lanes"). Within a single lane, when several tasks of that lane are eligible, the system SHALL start them in ascending order of the time they became eligible to run, breaking ties by the order in which they were scheduled, except for a task that is held back by "Per-Video Mutual Exclusion" or "Exclusive yt-dlp Update". Such a task SHALL be passed over without blocking later tasks of the same lane. Tasks in different lanes SHALL NOT be ordered relative to each other.

#### Scenario: Eligible task is dispatched
- **WHEN** a task's run time has passed and it has not yet succeeded
- **THEN** the system dispatches it to the handler registered for its type

#### Scenario: Earlier-due task runs first regardless of scheduling order
- **WHEN** two tasks of the same lane are eligible and the one scheduled later has an earlier run time
- **THEN** the system starts the task with the earlier run time first

#### Scenario: Tasks with the same run time
- **WHEN** two tasks of the same lane are eligible with identical run times
- **THEN** the system starts the one that was scheduled first before the other

#### Scenario: A running task is not dispatched again
- **WHEN** a task is already running and the system polls for eligible tasks again
- **THEN** that task is not dispatched a second time while its current attempt is running

#### Scenario: Held-back task does not block its lane
- **WHEN** the earliest eligible task of a lane cannot start because another task for the same video is running
- **THEN** the system starts the next eligible task of that lane that is not held back, and starts the held-back task once the conflicting task finishes

### Requirement: Retry With Fixed Delay Then Give Up
The system SHALL track a retry counter per task. On failure, the counter SHALL increment and the task SHALL become eligible again after a delay that grows with the number of prior attempts, starting from a configurable base delay, rather than a fixed delay. After 5 failed attempts, the system SHALL log the failure, move the task to the dead-letter table, and remove it from the tasks table so it is not attempted again.

#### Scenario: A task attempt fails
- **WHEN** a task's handler raises an error
- **THEN** the task's retry counter increments and it becomes eligible again after a delay that is longer than the delay used before its previous attempt

#### Scenario: Fifth consecutive failure
- **WHEN** a task's retry counter reaches 5 failed attempts
- **THEN** the system logs the failure, records the task's id, type, payload, final error, attempt count, and timestamps in the dead-letter table, and deletes the task from the tasks table

#### Scenario: Base retry delay not configured
- **WHEN** no base retry delay has been explicitly configured
- **THEN** the system uses its default base retry delay, applied uniformly to every task type

#### Scenario: Base retry delay configured
- **WHEN** a base retry delay has been explicitly configured
- **THEN** the system uses that value, applied uniformly to every task type, in place of the default

### Requirement: Dead-Letter Record for Permanently Failed Tasks
The system SHALL persist a durable record of every task that exhausts its retries, so a permanently failed task remains inspectable after it leaves the tasks table.

#### Scenario: Task moved to dead letter
- **WHEN** a task reaches its 5th failed attempt
- **THEN** a record containing the task's original id, type, payload, final error message, number of attempts, and timestamps is inserted into the dead-letter table

### Requirement: Tasks Table Behaves as a Queue
The system SHALL remove a task from the tasks table as soon as it reaches a terminal state, so the table only ever contains tasks that are pending, scheduled for retry, or currently running.

#### Scenario: Task completes successfully
- **WHEN** a task's handler returns successfully
- **THEN** the task is deleted from the tasks table rather than being retained with a completed status

#### Scenario: Task exhausts retries
- **WHEN** a task reaches its 5th failed attempt, including one recovered from a crash, and is moved to the dead-letter table
- **THEN** it is also deleted from the tasks table

### Requirement: Crash Recovery
The system SHALL, on startup and before resuming normal task execution, treat any task still marked as running from a previous, interrupted process as a failed attempt. While running, the system SHALL also treat any task still marked as running that no attempt in the current process is running (for example, because recording its outcome failed) as a failed attempt, no later than its next check for eligible tasks, so such a task neither waits for a restart nor keeps blocking later tasks for its video (see "No Duplicate Per-Video Tasks").

#### Scenario: Daemon restarts with a task stuck running
- **WHEN** the daemon starts and finds a task in a running state left over from a previous run
- **THEN** it increments that task's retry counter and applies the same retry-then-give-up handling as any other failed attempt, before task execution resumes

#### Scenario: Task left running with no attempt in progress
- **WHEN** the daemon is running and a task is marked as running although no attempt of it is in progress, for example because its outcome could not be recorded
- **THEN** on its next check for eligible tasks the system increments that task's retry counter and applies the same retry-then-give-up handling as any other failed attempt, without waiting for a restart

#### Scenario: Later task for the same video after recovery
- **WHEN** a download task left running with no attempt in progress has been recovered, and a new download is then scheduled for the same video
- **THEN** the new request is treated like any other request for a video that already has a pending download

### Requirement: Task Lanes
The system SHALL execute tasks in lanes, each with its own maximum number of tasks running at the same time:
- a **download lane**, containing video downloads, whose concurrency is configurable,
- a **thumbnail lane**, containing thumbnail fetches, with a concurrency of 1,
- a **subtitle lane**, containing subtitle fetches, with a concurrency of 1,
- a **video sync lane**, containing video syncs (see `video-sync`), with a concurrency of 1,
- a **summary lane**, containing video summaries, with a concurrency of 1,
- a **light lane**, containing every other task type except thumbnail fetches, subtitle fetches, video syncs, video summaries and the yt-dlp update (reconciles and file deletions), with a concurrency of 1.

A lane SHALL start a new eligible task whenever it has fewer tasks running than its concurrency. A long-running task in one lane SHALL NOT delay the start of eligible tasks in another lane.

#### Scenario: Downloads run in parallel up to the lane's concurrency
- **WHEN** the download lane's concurrency is 2 and three video downloads are eligible
- **THEN** two of them run at the same time, and the third starts as soon as one of the first two finishes

#### Scenario: Light tasks are not blocked by downloads
- **WHEN** the download lane is fully busy with long-running downloads and a reconcile or file-deletion task becomes eligible
- **THEN** that task starts without waiting for any download to finish

#### Scenario: Light lane runs one task at a time
- **WHEN** two light-lane tasks are eligible at the same time
- **THEN** the system runs one, and starts the other only after the first finishes

#### Scenario: Reconciles and deletes are not blocked by thumbnail fetches
- **WHEN** many thumbnail fetches are queued, one of them is running, and a reconcile or file-deletion task becomes eligible
- **THEN** that task starts without waiting for any of the thumbnail fetches to finish

#### Scenario: Thumbnail lane runs one fetch at a time
- **WHEN** two thumbnail fetches for different videos are eligible at the same time
- **THEN** the system runs one, and starts the other only after the first finishes

#### Scenario: Subtitle backfill does not block other work
- **WHEN** many subtitle fetches are queued, one of them is running, and a video download, thumbnail fetch, reconcile or file-deletion task becomes eligible
- **THEN** that task starts without waiting for any of the subtitle fetches to finish

#### Scenario: Subtitle lane runs one fetch at a time
- **WHEN** two subtitle fetches for different videos are eligible at the same time
- **THEN** the system runs one, and starts the other only after the first finishes

#### Scenario: Video syncs are not blocked by reconciles
- **WHEN** a playlist or channel reconcile is running and a video sync becomes eligible
- **THEN** the video sync starts without waiting for the reconcile to finish

#### Scenario: Video sync lane runs one sync at a time
- **WHEN** two video syncs for different videos are eligible at the same time
- **THEN** the system runs one, and starts the other only after the first finishes

#### Scenario: Summary backlog does not block other work
- **WHEN** many video summaries are queued, one of them is running, no exclusive task is eligible, and a video download, thumbnail fetch, reconcile or file-deletion task becomes eligible
- **THEN** that task starts without waiting for any of the summaries to finish

#### Scenario: Summary lane runs one summary at a time
- **WHEN** two video summaries for different videos are eligible at the same time
- **THEN** the system runs one, and starts the other only after the first finishes

### Requirement: Configurable Download Concurrency
The system SHALL read the download lane's concurrency from the `YARRTUBE_DOWNLOAD_CONCURRENCY` environment variable at daemon startup, and SHALL default to 2 when it is unset or is not a positive integer.

#### Scenario: Download concurrency not configured
- **WHEN** the daemon starts without `YARRTUBE_DOWNLOAD_CONCURRENCY` set
- **THEN** at most 2 video downloads run at the same time

#### Scenario: Download concurrency configured
- **WHEN** the daemon starts with `YARRTUBE_DOWNLOAD_CONCURRENCY` set to a positive integer N
- **THEN** at most N video downloads run at the same time

#### Scenario: Invalid download concurrency
- **WHEN** the daemon starts with `YARRTUBE_DOWNLOAD_CONCURRENCY` set to zero, a negative number, or a non-numeric value
- **THEN** the system uses the default of 2

### Requirement: Exclusive yt-dlp Update
The system SHALL run a yt-dlp update task only while no other task is running, and SHALL NOT start any other task while that update task is running. While an eligible yt-dlp update task is waiting for running tasks to finish, the system SHALL NOT start any new task in any lane.

#### Scenario: Update becomes eligible while downloads are running
- **WHEN** a yt-dlp update task becomes eligible while one or more other tasks are running
- **THEN** the system starts no new task, waits for the running tasks to finish, and then runs the update

#### Scenario: Tasks become eligible while the update runs
- **WHEN** a yt-dlp update task is running and other tasks become eligible
- **THEN** none of them start until the update task finishes

### Requirement: Per-Video Mutual Exclusion
The system SHALL NOT run two tasks that operate on the same video at the same time. A video download, a thumbnail fetch, a subtitle fetch, a video summary and a video sync of the same video all count as operating on the same video, as do two tasks of the same type for the same video.

#### Scenario: Thumbnail fetch eligible while the same video downloads
- **WHEN** a thumbnail fetch task for a video is eligible while that video's download task is running
- **THEN** the thumbnail fetch does not start until the download task finishes

#### Scenario: Download eligible while the same video's thumbnail is fetched
- **WHEN** a download task for a video is eligible while a thumbnail fetch task for that same video is running
- **THEN** the download does not start until the thumbnail fetch finishes

#### Scenario: Tasks for different videos
- **WHEN** a download task for one video and a thumbnail fetch task for a different video are both eligible
- **THEN** both may run at the same time

#### Scenario: Video sync eligible while the same video downloads
- **WHEN** a video sync for a video is eligible while that video's download task is running
- **THEN** the video sync does not start until the download task finishes

#### Scenario: Video sync eligible while the same video is summarized
- **WHEN** a video sync for a video is eligible while that video's summary is running
- **THEN** the sync does not start until the summary finishes

### Requirement: No Duplicate Per-Video Tasks
The system SHALL NOT add a video download task, a thumbnail fetch task, or a subtitle fetch task for a video that already has a task of that same type pending or running, and SHALL NOT add a video sync for a video that already has a video sync pending. Such a scheduling request SHALL succeed without adding a task.

#### Scenario: Download already queued for the video
- **WHEN** a download task is scheduled for a video that already has a pending or running download task
- **THEN** no additional download task is added, and the request does not fail

#### Scenario: Thumbnail fetch already queued for the video
- **WHEN** a thumbnail fetch task is scheduled for a video that already has a pending or running thumbnail fetch task
- **THEN** no additional thumbnail fetch task is added, and the request does not fail

#### Scenario: Previous task for the video already finished
- **WHEN** a download or thumbnail fetch task is scheduled for a video whose previous task of that type has already completed or been dead-lettered
- **THEN** a new task is added

#### Scenario: Video sync already pending
- **WHEN** a video sync is scheduled for a video that already has a pending video sync
- **THEN** no additional video sync is added, and the request does not fail

#### Scenario: Video sync requested while one is running
- **WHEN** a video sync is scheduled for a video whose only video sync is currently running
- **THEN** a new video sync is added, so a change made while the running one reads the video is not missed
