# video-listing Specification

## Purpose

Provides an HTTP endpoint to list the videos belonging to a single tracked playlist, so a playlist's contents can be browsed.

## Requirements

### Requirement: List Videos For A Playlist
The system SHALL provide an HTTP endpoint that, given a tracked playlist's ID, returns every video recorded for that playlist except those that are excluded, including each video's ID, title, status, quality (when downloaded), filename (when downloaded), thumbnail filename (when present), duration in seconds (when present), whether it has been watched, and its saved playback position in seconds. The returned videos SHALL be ordered by their current position in the source YouTube playlist.

#### Scenario: Playlist has videos
- **WHEN** a client requests the videos of a tracked playlist that has one or more recorded videos
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 200 and a list containing each of those videos

#### Scenario: Playlist has no videos
- **WHEN** a client requests the videos of a tracked playlist that has no recorded videos
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 200 and an empty list

#### Scenario: Playlist does not exist
- **WHEN** a client requests the videos of a playlist ID that is not currently tracked
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 400 and does not return a list

#### Scenario: YouTube-linked playlist's videos are ordered by playlist position
- **WHEN** a client requests the videos of a YouTube-linked playlist
- **THEN** the daemon returns them ordered by their position in the source YouTube playlist, matching the order they appear in on YouTube

#### Scenario: Playlist videos include their watch state
- **WHEN** a client requests the videos of a tracked playlist that has a watched video and a partly watched video
- **THEN** each returned video reports whether it has been watched and its saved playback position

#### Scenario: Excluded videos are omitted
- **WHEN** a client requests the videos of a tracked playlist that has an excluded video alongside other videos
- **THEN** the returned list contains the other videos and does not contain the excluded one

### Requirement: List Videos For A Channel
The system SHALL provide an HTTP endpoint that, given a tracked channel's handle, returns every video recorded for that channel except those that are excluded, including each video's ID, title, status, quality (when downloaded), filename (when downloaded), thumbnail filename (when present), duration in seconds (when present), whether it has been watched, and its saved playback position in seconds, ordered by recency (most recently uploaded first).

#### Scenario: Channel has videos
- **WHEN** a client requests the videos of a tracked channel that has one or more recorded videos
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 200 and a list containing each of those videos, ordered most recent first

#### Scenario: Channel has no videos
- **WHEN** a client requests the videos of a tracked channel that has no recorded videos
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 200 and an empty list

#### Scenario: Channel does not exist
- **WHEN** a client requests the videos of a channel handle that is not currently tracked
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 400 and does not return a list

#### Scenario: Channel videos include their watch state
- **WHEN** a client requests the videos of a tracked channel that has a watched video and a partly watched video
- **THEN** each returned video reports whether it has been watched and its saved playback position

#### Scenario: Excluded videos are omitted
- **WHEN** a client requests the videos of a tracked channel that has an excluded video alongside other videos
- **THEN** the returned list contains the other videos and does not contain the excluded one

### Requirement: Listed Videos Include Sync Time
The system SHALL include each video's recorded sync time in the responses that list the videos of a playlist and of a channel, and SHALL report it as absent for a video that has none.

#### Scenario: Downloaded video is listed
- **WHEN** a client lists the videos of a tracked playlist or channel that has a downloaded video
- **THEN** that video's entry includes its sync time

#### Scenario: Video without a sync time is listed
- **WHEN** a client lists the videos of a tracked playlist or channel that has a video with no recorded sync time
- **THEN** that video's entry reports its sync time as absent

### Requirement: Listed Videos Include Their Metadata
The system SHALL include each video's publish time and channel name, taken from its generated metadata, in the responses that list the videos of a playlist and of a channel. These responses SHALL NOT include the video's description. For a video whose metadata has not been generated, the system SHALL report both as absent.

#### Scenario: Video with generated metadata is listed
- **WHEN** a client lists the videos of a tracked playlist or channel that has a video with generated metadata
- **THEN** that video's entry includes its publish time and the name of the channel that published it, and no description

#### Scenario: Video without generated metadata is listed
- **WHEN** a client lists the videos of a tracked playlist or channel that has a video whose metadata has not been generated
- **THEN** that video's entry reports its publish time and channel name as absent, and every other field is still returned

### Requirement: List Home Videos Across Sources
The system SHALL provide an HTTP endpoint that returns, in one response, the downloaded videos of the home sections across every tracked channel and every tracked playlist not excluded from home, so that a YouTube video appears in at most one section.

A playlist excluded from home SHALL NOT be the source of any video in any section. A video it tracks SHALL still appear when another source that is not excluded tracks it, through that source.

"Continue watching" SHALL hold up to 6 videos the user has started and not finished recently:
- each is unwatched, with a saved playback position greater than 30 seconds, and was last played within the past 7 days
- ordered by last played time, most recent first

"Quick watches" SHALL hold up to 6 short videos:
- each is unwatched, with a recorded duration shorter than 15 minutes (900 seconds), and not shown under "Continue watching" or any category section
- ordered by sync time (the time the video was recorded by the system), newest first

Category sections, described in "Home Category Sections", SHALL come after "Continue watching" and before "Quick watches".

In these sections, a YouTube video tracked by more than one source SHALL appear once, from a tracking channel when there is one.

"Latest videos" SHALL hold up to 18 videos that are not shown under "Continue watching", any category section or "Quick watches", ordered by sync time, newest first, once per source that tracks them.

Only the videos a section shows SHALL be left out of the sections after it.

Each returned video SHALL include:
- its ID and title
- its thumbnail filename and duration in seconds, when present
- whether it has been watched, and its saved playback position in seconds
- the source that tracks it: kind (`playlist` or `channel`), identifier, display name, storage path, and, for a channel source, that channel's avatar filename when present

### Requirement: List Videos For A Category
The system SHALL provide an HTTP endpoint that, given a category's identifier, returns the downloaded videos of all the category's members, each YouTube video once, ordered by sync time (the time the video was recorded by the system), newest first. When a YouTube video is tracked by more than one member, it SHALL be returned from a tracking channel when there is one. Playlists excluded from home SHALL still contribute their videos. Each returned video SHALL include every field a video has in the responses that list the videos of a playlist and of a channel, taken from the copy of the source it is returned from: its status, quality, file name, thumbnail, duration, watch state and position, record and sync times, publish time, channel name and subtitle language. Each SHALL also include the source that tracks it and its categories. When no category has the identifier, the endpoint SHALL respond with HTTP status 404.

#### Scenario: Videos across members

- **THEN** its downloaded videos are still returned

#### Scenario: Category without members
- **WHEN** the category has no members
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 200 and no videos

#### Scenario: Unknown category
- **WHEN** a client lists the videos of a category identifier that does not exist
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 404

### Requirement: Home And Category Videos Include Their Categories
Each video returned by the home endpoint and the category videos endpoint SHALL include the identifiers of the categories it belongs to, ordered by category name ignoring case, each once. A video SHALL belong to a category when any of the category's members has that YouTube video downloaded, whichever source the video is returned from. Members whose unwatched count is hidden or that are excluded from home SHALL still count. A video in no category SHALL include an empty list.

#### Scenario: Video in one category

- **THEN** its category identifiers are those of ["Chess", "Highlights"]

#### Scenario: Category reached by two members once
- **WHEN** a YouTube video is tracked by two members of "Chess"
- **THEN** "Chess" appears once among its category identifiers

#### Scenario: No category
- **WHEN** a home video's YouTube video is tracked by no member of any category
- **THEN** its category identifiers are an empty list

#### Scenario: Category videos include their categories
- **WHEN** a video listed for the category "Chess" is also tracked by a member of "Streams"
- **THEN** its category identifiers are those of ["Chess", "Streams"]

### Requirement: Home Category Sections
The home endpoint SHALL return up to 3 category sections, each with the category's identifier, name and color and up to 6 of its pending videos: downloaded, unwatched videos from the home sources that belong to the category and are not shown under "Continue watching" or an earlier category section, newest sync first. A category with no such videos SHALL get no section.

#### Scenario: Category with pending videos
- **WHEN** "Chess" has 2 downloaded, unwatched videos and no other category has any

- **THEN** it appears in no category section

#### Scenario: Video reached through a source shown on home
- **WHEN** a pending video belongs to "Highlights" through a playlist excluded from home and is also tracked by a channel that is not excluded
- **THEN** it can appear in the "Highlights" section, with the channel as its source

### Requirement: Home Category Section Ranking
Categories SHALL be ranked by their number of pending videos not shown under "Continue watching", counted in full and not only up to 6, most first, ties broken by category name ignoring case. Sections SHALL follow the ranking; a category left without videos once those shown in earlier sections are removed SHALL be skipped and the next ranked category SHALL take its place, until 3 sections are filled or no category remains.

#### Scenario: Most pending first
- **WHEN** "Chess" has 4 pending videos, "Science" has 9 and "Streams" has 1
- **THEN** the sections are, in order, "Science", "Chess" and "Streams"

- **THEN** the second-ranked category gets no section and the fourth one does

### Requirement: Home Sections Follow Preferences
The home endpoint SHALL return an empty list for each section turned off in the preferences: "Continue watching" when `home_show_continue_watching` is off, "Quick watches" when `home_show_quick_watches` is off, "Latest videos" when `home_show_latest` is off, and no category sections when `home_show_categories` or `categories_enabled` is off. A section turned off SHALL show no video, so videos it would have held can appear in the sections after it.

#### Scenario: Continue watching turned off
- **WHEN** `home_show_continue_watching` is off and an unwatched short video has been started recently
- **THEN** "Continue watching" is empty and the video appears under "Quick watches"

- **THEN** the response holds no category sections, and Chess's videos can appear under "Quick watches" or "Latest videos"

#### Scenario: Home category sections turned off
- **WHEN** `categories_enabled` is on, `home_show_categories` is off and "Chess" has pending videos
- **THEN** the response holds no category sections

#### Scenario: Latest videos turned off

- **THEN** its entry has `published_at` set to `null`

### Requirement: Listed Videos Include Their Chapters
The system SHALL include each video's recorded chapters, in playback order, in the responses that list the videos of a playlist, of a channel and of a category: each chapter's start and end in whole seconds and its title. A video recorded as having no chapters, or whose chapters were never checked, SHALL be reported with an empty chapter list.

#### Scenario: Video with chapters is listed
- **WHEN** a client lists the videos of a tracked playlist, channel or category that has a video recorded with chapters "Game 1" (0–1037 s) and "Game 2" (1037–2201 s)
- **THEN** that video's entry includes exactly those two chapters, in that order, each with its start, end and title

#### Scenario: Video without chapters is listed

- **THEN** that video's entry includes an empty chapter list, and every other field is still returned

### Requirement: Listed Videos Include Their Summary
The system SHALL include each video's AI summary text in the responses that list the videos of a playlist, of a channel and of a category. It SHALL be reported as absent for a video with no stored summary, and for one whose summary is hidden (see `video-summaries`). In a category, whether it is hidden SHALL follow the source the video is returned from.

#### Scenario: Video with a summary is listed
- **WHEN** AI and summaries are on and a client lists the videos of a tracked playlist, channel or category whose source has summaries enabled and that has a video with a stored summary
- **THEN** that video's entry includes the summary's text

#### Scenario: Video without a summary is listed
- **WHEN** a client lists a video that has no stored summary, whether it is waiting for one or was given up on
- **THEN** that video's entry reports its summary as absent, and every other field is still returned

#### Scenario: Hidden summary is listed
