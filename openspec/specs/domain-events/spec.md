# domain-events Specification

## Purpose

Provides a persisted, asynchronous mechanism for publishing domain events and dispatching each one to every independent subscriber registered for its type, so reacting to something that happened never blocks or risks the operation that caused it.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Durable Publication
The system SHALL persist an event before returning from the publish call, independent of whether or when it is ever consumed.

#### Scenario: Successful publish persists the event
- **WHEN** a domain event is published
- **THEN** the system records it in a pending state before the publish call returns

#### Scenario: Publish does not wait for processing
- **WHEN** a domain event is published
- **THEN** the publish call returns without waiting for any subscriber to run

### Requirement: Asynchronous Multi-Subscriber Dispatch
The system SHALL poll for pending events in the background and, for each one, invoke every subscriber currently registered for that event's type.

#### Scenario: One subscriber registered
- **WHEN** a pending event's type has exactly one registered subscriber
- **THEN** that subscriber is invoked with the event's payload

#### Scenario: Multiple subscribers registered
- **WHEN** a pending event's type has more than one registered subscriber
- **THEN** every registered subscriber is invoked

#### Scenario: No subscribers registered
- **WHEN** a pending event's type has no registered subscribers
- **THEN** the system marks the event processed without invoking anything and without treating it as an error

### Requirement: Retry Then Give Up
The system SHALL track a single retry counter per event. If any subscriber invocation for an event fails, the counter SHALL increment and the event SHALL remain eligible for another attempt, in which every subscriber for that event is invoked again. After 5 failed attempts, the system SHALL log the failure, move the event to the dead-letter table, and remove it from the events table so it is not attempted again.

#### Scenario: A subscriber fails
- **WHEN** any subscriber invoked for an event raises an error
- **THEN** the event's retry counter increments and the event remains pending for another attempt, in which all of its subscribers are invoked again, including ones that already succeeded on a prior attempt

#### Scenario: Fifth consecutive failure
- **WHEN** an event's retry counter reaches 5 failed attempts
- **THEN** the system logs the failure, records the event's id, type, payload, final error, attempt count, and timestamps in the dead-letter table, and deletes the event from the events table

### Requirement: Dead-Letter Record for Permanently Failed Events
The system SHALL persist a durable record of every event that exhausts its retries, so a permanently failed event remains inspectable after it leaves the events table.

#### Scenario: Event moved to dead letter
- **WHEN** an event reaches its 5th failed attempt
- **THEN** a record containing the event's original id, type, payload, final error message, number of attempts, and timestamps is inserted into the dead-letter table

### Requirement: Events Table Behaves as a Queue
The system SHALL remove an event from the events table as soon as it reaches a terminal state, so the table only ever contains events that are still pending or eligible for retry.

#### Scenario: Event processed successfully
- **WHEN** every subscriber for an event succeeds
- **THEN** the event is deleted from the events table rather than being retained with a completed status

#### Scenario: Event exhausts retries
- **WHEN** an event reaches its 5th failed attempt and is moved to the dead-letter table
- **THEN** it is also deleted from the events table

### Requirement: Isolation from the Publisher
The system SHALL ensure that a failure or delay in processing an event never affects the outcome already returned by the operation that published it.

#### Scenario: Subscriber fails after publish already returned
- **WHEN** a subscriber invocation for an event fails
- **THEN** the operation that published the event is unaffected, since it already completed before the event was processed

### Requirement: Subscriber Panic Counts As A Failure
The system SHALL treat a subscriber that panics while handling an event as a failed invocation, the same as one that returns an error: the event's retry counter increments, the event follows the retry and dead-letter rules, and the panic's message is recorded as the event's error. A panic MUST NOT stop the consumer from processing the other pending events.

#### Scenario: A subscriber panics
- **WHEN** a subscriber invoked for an event panics
- **THEN** the event's retry counter increments and its error records that the subscriber panicked, with the panic message

#### Scenario: A subscriber panics on the fifth attempt
- **WHEN** a subscriber panics on an event's 5th attempt
- **THEN** the event is moved to the dead-letter table and deleted from the events table

#### Scenario: Other events still processed after a panic
- **WHEN** a subscriber panics on one pending event and other events are pending in the same poll
- **THEN** the other events are dispatched to their subscribers in that same poll
