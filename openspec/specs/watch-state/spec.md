# watch-state Specification

## Purpose

Tracks whether each video has been watched, and where playback stopped, so the web UI can resume videos, mark watched ones, and count unwatched uploads per channel.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Watch State Per YouTube Video
The system SHALL record, for each video, whether it has been watched and its saved playback position in whole seconds. A video that has never been played SHALL be unwatched with a saved position of 0. Watch state SHALL belong to the YouTube video: every change SHALL apply to every stored copy of that YouTube video, whichever playlist or channel tracks it. A download SHALL NOT undo a watch state recorded while it was in flight.

#### Scenario: A newly recorded video is unwatched
- **WHEN** a video is recorded for a playlist or channel for the first time
- **THEN** it is unwatched with a saved playback position of 0

#### Scenario: A change applies to every stored copy
- **WHEN** the same YouTube video is tracked by both a channel and a playlist, and its watch state changes
- **THEN** both stored copies report the same new watch state

#### Scenario: Watch state survives a redownload
- **WHEN** a watched video's file goes missing and the video is scheduled for a fresh download
- **THEN** the video stays watched

#### Scenario: Watch state survives a download in flight
- **WHEN** a video's watch state changes while its download is in progress, e.g. because another copy of it was marked watched, and the download then succeeds, fails or ends excluded
- **THEN** the video keeps the watch state recorded during the download

### Requirement: Record Playback Progress
The system SHALL provide an HTTP endpoint that, given a YouTube video ID and a playback position in whole seconds (plus, optionally, the duration reported by the player), records playback progress for every stored copy of that video. Each report SHALL state whether the client believed the video watched when its playback began (`was_watched`). A report SHALL be stale when it states the video was unwatched but the video is now watched. The video was marked watched after that playback began, so the reported position predates the mark. A stale report SHALL change nothing. The recorded duration SHALL be used. The reported duration SHALL be used only when no duration is recorded. When included, the reported duration SHALL be a positive number of whole seconds. The endpoint SHALL respond with HTTP status 200 on success, including stale reports, with a body stating whether the video is watched once the report is applied (`{ "watched": true }` or `{ "watched": false }`). It SHALL accept requests sent as a browser beacon on page unload.

#### Scenario: Progress on an unwatched video
- **WHEN** a client records a position below 90% of the video's duration for an unwatched video
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 200 and `watched: false`, the video stays unwatched, and its saved position becomes the given position

#### Scenario: Progress reaches 90%
- **WHEN** a client records a position at or above 90% of the video's duration for an unwatched video
- **THEN** the daemon responds with `watched: true`, the video becomes watched and its saved position resets to 0

#### Scenario: Duration only known by the player
- **WHEN** a client records progress for a video with no recorded duration and includes the player's duration
- **THEN** the 90% rule is applied against the player's duration

#### Scenario: Duration unknown
- **WHEN** a client records progress for a video with no recorded duration and no player duration
- **THEN** the saved position becomes the given position and the video's watched status does not change

#### Scenario: Early in a rewatch
- **WHEN** a client that believed the video watched records a position at or below 10% of the duration for a watched video
- **THEN** the video stays watched and its saved position stays 0

#### Scenario: Rewatch passes 10%
- **WHEN** a client that believed the video watched records a position above 10% and below 90% of the duration for a watched video
- **THEN** the daemon responds with `watched: false`, the video becomes unwatched and its saved position becomes the given position

#### Scenario: Playing on past 90%
- **WHEN** a client that believed the video watched records a position at or above 90% of the duration for a watched video
- **THEN** the video stays watched and its saved position stays 0

#### Scenario: Stale report after the video was marked watched
- **WHEN** a client that believed the video unwatched records a position above 10% and below 90% of the duration for a video that is now watched
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 200 and `watched: true`, and the video stays watched with a saved position of 0

#### Scenario: Video un-watched elsewhere
- **WHEN** a client that believed the video watched records progress for a video that is now unwatched
- **THEN** the report is applied by the unwatched-video rules

#### Scenario: Unknown video
- **WHEN** a client records progress for a YouTube video ID that no playlist or channel tracks
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 400 and records nothing

#### Scenario: Invalid reported duration
- **WHEN** a client records progress with a reported duration of 0 or less
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 400 and records nothing

#### Scenario: Missing or invalid position
- **WHEN** a client records progress without a position, or with a negative position
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 400 and records nothing

#### Scenario: Missing believed watched state
- **WHEN** a client records progress without stating whether it believed the video watched
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 400 and records nothing

### Requirement: Mark A Channel Watched
The system SHALL provide an HTTP endpoint that, given a tracked channel's handle, marks every downloaded video of that channel as watched, including every other stored copy of those videos. Videos in the channel that have not finished downloading SHALL be left unchanged. The endpoint SHALL respond with HTTP status 204.

#### Scenario: Marking a channel watched
- **WHEN** a client marks a tracked channel as watched
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 204 and every downloaded video of the channel is watched

#### Scenario: Videos still downloading are left unchanged
- **WHEN** a client marks a channel as watched while some of its videos are pending or downloading
- **THEN** those videos stay unwatched

#### Scenario: Channel does not exist
- **WHEN** a client marks as watched a channel handle that is not currently tracked
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 400 and changes nothing

#### Scenario: Invalid handle
- **WHEN** a client marks as watched a value that is not a valid channel handle
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 400 and changes nothing

### Requirement: Mark A Video Watched
The system SHALL provide an HTTP endpoint that, given a YouTube video ID, marks every stored copy of that video as watched, with its saved position reset to 0. A video SHALL be marked only when at least one of its stored copies has finished downloading. A video that is already watched SHALL be left unchanged. On success the endpoint SHALL respond with HTTP status 204.

#### Scenario: Marking a video watched
- **WHEN** a client marks a downloaded, unwatched video as watched
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 204, the video is watched and its saved position is 0

#### Scenario: Every stored copy is marked
- **WHEN** a client marks as watched a video tracked by both a channel and a playlist
- **THEN** both stored copies are watched, and both the channel's and the playlist's unwatched counts drop by one

#### Scenario: Marking drops the video from continue watching
- **WHEN** a client marks as watched a video listed under "Continue watching"
- **THEN** the video no longer qualifies for "Continue watching", and its channel's unwatched count drops by one

#### Scenario: Already watched video
- **WHEN** a client marks as watched a video that is already watched
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 204 and the video's watched time is unchanged

#### Scenario: Unknown video
- **WHEN** a client marks as watched a YouTube video ID that no playlist or channel tracks
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 400 and changes nothing

#### Scenario: Video not downloaded
- **WHEN** a client marks as watched a video none of whose stored copies has finished downloading
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 400 and changes nothing

### Requirement: Last Played Time
The system SHALL record, for each video, the time playback progress was last recorded for it. Every successful progress report that is not stale SHALL set this time on every stored copy of that YouTube video, whether or not the report changes the video's watched status or saved position. A video whose progress has never been recorded SHALL have no last played time. Marking a channel or a single video watched SHALL NOT change any video's last played time.

#### Scenario: Progress sets the last played time
- **WHEN** a client records playback progress for a video
- **THEN** every stored copy of that video has its last played time set to the time of the report

#### Scenario: Progress that doesn't change the watch state still counts as played
- **WHEN** a client that believed the video watched records a position at or below 10% of the duration for a watched video
- **THEN** the video stays watched, and its last played time is set to the time of the report

#### Scenario: A newly recorded video has never been played
- **WHEN** a video is recorded for a playlist or channel for the first time
- **THEN** it has no last played time

#### Scenario: Marking a channel watched leaves last played times alone
- **WHEN** a client marks a tracked channel as watched
- **THEN** the last played time of each of its videos is unchanged

#### Scenario: Marking a video watched leaves its last played time alone
- **WHEN** a client marks a single video as watched
- **THEN** the last played time of each of its stored copies is unchanged

#### Scenario: A stale report records nothing
- **WHEN** a progress report is stale
- **THEN** no video's last played time changes

#### Scenario: Rejected progress records nothing
- **WHEN** a progress report is rejected as invalid or for an unknown video
- **THEN** no video's last played time changes

### Requirement: Mark A Category Watched
The system SHALL provide an HTTP endpoint that, given a category's identifier, marks every downloaded video of every member of the category as watched, including every other stored copy of those videos. Videos that have not finished downloading SHALL be left unchanged. The endpoint SHALL respond with HTTP status 204. When no category has the identifier, the endpoint SHALL respond with HTTP status 404.

#### Scenario: Category marked watched
- **WHEN** a client marks the category "Chess" watched, and its channel and playlist members have downloaded, unwatched videos
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 204, every downloaded video of both members is watched, and the category's unwatched count is 0

#### Scenario: Copies outside the category
- **WHEN** a video of a member of the category is also tracked by a source outside the category, and the category is marked watched
- **THEN** that other copy is watched too

#### Scenario: Videos still downloading
- **WHEN** a member of the category has a video that has not finished downloading, and the category is marked watched
- **THEN** that video stays unwatched

#### Scenario: Unknown category
- **WHEN** a client marks a category identifier that does not exist watched
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 404

### Requirement: Mark A Playlist Watched
The system SHALL provide an HTTP endpoint that, given a tracked playlist's ID, marks every downloaded video of that playlist as watched, including every other stored copy of those videos, such as their copies in channels. Videos in the playlist that have not finished downloading SHALL be left unchanged. The endpoint SHALL respond with HTTP status 204.

#### Scenario: Marking a playlist watched
- **WHEN** a client marks a tracked playlist as watched
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 204, every downloaded video of the playlist is watched, and its unwatched count becomes 0

#### Scenario: Copies in channels are marked too
- **WHEN** a client marks a playlist as watched and one of its downloaded videos is also tracked by a channel
- **THEN** the channel's copy is watched too, and the channel's unwatched count drops accordingly

#### Scenario: Playlist videos still downloading are left unchanged
- **WHEN** a client marks a playlist as watched while some of its videos are pending or downloading
- **THEN** those videos stay unwatched

#### Scenario: Playlist does not exist
- **WHEN** a client marks as watched a playlist ID that is not currently tracked
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 400 and changes nothing

#### Scenario: Invalid playlist ID
- **WHEN** a client marks as watched a value that is not a valid playlist ID
- **THEN** the daemon responds with HTTP status 400 and changes nothing
