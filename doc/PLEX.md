# Plex (TV Shows library)

## What you get

Every tracked playlist and channel shows up in Plex (and Kodi or Jellyfin)
as a **TV show**: one tile per playlist/channel, episode thumbnails,
subtitles, Continue Watching, On Deck and "play next episode".

```

- **Channels** get one season per year, with episodes ordered by publish
  date.
- **Playlists** are a single season in playlist order. New videos are added
  at the end.

Episode numbers never change, so Plex keeps your watch progress.

### Subtitles

Each episode also gets its captions, saved next to it as
`S2026E031501 - Title.en.srt`, which Plex picks up as a subtitle track.
They're in the video's original language: the uploader's captions, else
YouTube's auto-generated ones, never translations. Whether Plex turns them
on by itself depends on each user's settings (_Account → Languages_).

YouTube can take a while to generate captions for new videos, so yarrtube keeps
trying for about a week. After upgrading, captions for episodes already
downloaded are fetched in the background.

### Chapters

When a video has YouTube chapters, they're embedded in its file as chapter
markers, so Plex (and Kodi or Jellyfin) shows a chapter list in the player
to jump between them. For a picture per chapter, turn on _Settings → Library
→ Generate chapter thumbnails_. Only videos downloaded since chapters were
added get them in the file; older episodes keep playing without.

## Setup

Setting up Plex takes two steps, and only the first is required. The second
makes new episodes show up in Plex right after they download, and gives you
[category playlists](CATEGORIES.md#in-plex) for free.

### 1. Set up a TV Shows library

Create a **TV Shows** library over the folders holding yarrtube's videos
(for example the host folders mounted at `/videos/playlists` and
`/videos/channels`), and in its _Advanced_ settings:

- **Scanner**: Plex TV Series.
- **Agent**: **Plex NFO Series**.
- **Seasons**: _Hide for single-season series_.
- **Use local assets**: on, for posters and thumbnails.

The Plex NFO agents need Plex Media Server 1.43.1 or newer. If **Plex NFO
Series** is missing from the agent list:

- Check the server version under _Settings → General_ and update if it's
  older than 1.43.1.
- After upgrading from a version without the NFO agents, restart Plex Media
  Server once more by hand.
- If it still isn't listed, open the server's own web app at
  `http://<YOUR_PLEX_IP>:32400/web` and create the library there. The
  hosted app at app.plex.tv may not list it yet, even after an upgrade.

Optionally enable _Settings → Library → Scan my library automatically_ and
_Run a partial scan when changes are detected_: Plex then imports new
episodes on its own, and the scan trigger below just makes it immediate.

### 2. Scan trigger (optional)

With the scan trigger on, yarrtube asks Plex to scan a show as soon as one
of its videos finishes downloading, and again once that video's subtitle
file is written. After you
[move a playlist or channel](INSTALLATION.md#moving-a-playlist-or-channel),
it asks Plex to scan both the show's new folder and its old one, so Plex
picks the show up at its new location and drops it from the old. You need:

- A Plex token (`X-Plex-Token`) to authenticate yarrtube's requests.
- The path at which the Plex server sees yarrtube's videos root.

#### Get your Plex token (`YARRTUBE_PLEX_TOKEN`)

Follow Plex's official guide:
[Finding an authentication token / X-Plex-Token](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/).

Short version: in the Plex web app, open any library item → `⋯` →
_Get Info_ → _View XML_, and copy the `X-Plex-Token=...` value from the
opened page's URL.

If you can't find _View XML_, or you have a shell on the Plex server, you
can read the token from its `Preferences.xml` instead. On a Linux package
install:

```bash
sudo grep -o 'PlexOnlineToken="[^"]*"' \
  "/var/lib/plexmediaserver/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Preferences.xml"
```

The value between the quotes is the token. Treat it like a password: it
gives full access to your Plex account and server.

#### Configure yarrtube

Set the environment variables on the yarrtube container and restart it:

```yaml
environment:
  - YARRTUBE_PLEX_URL=http://<YOUR_PLEX_IP>:32400
  - YARRTUBE_PLEX_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>
  # the path at which Plex sees yarrtube's videos root, i.e. the host side
  # of the /videos volume (e.g. /volume1/data/media/yarrtube):
  - YARRTUBE_PLEX_VIDEOS_PATH=<HOST_PATH_MOUNTED_AT_/videos>
```

All three are required: with only some of them set, yarrtube logs a
warning and never contacts Plex.

`localhost` inside the container is not your Docker host. If Plex runs on
the same machine, use its LAN IP (e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:32400`) or run
yarrtube with `network_mode: host` (then set `YARRTUBE_PORT` for the web
UI, since `ports:` is ignored).

## Category playlists

Once the scan trigger is configured (step 2), each yarrtube category also
becomes a smart playlist in Plex. Nothing else to set up. See
[Categories](CATEGORIES.md#in-plex) for what you get and its limits.

## Troubleshooting

- **A YouTube playlist's show has no poster**: expected, only channels have one (their
  avatar).
- **Episodes show as "Episode 31502" without their title**: the library is
  not using the **Plex NFO Series** agent, or _Use local assets_ is off.
- **New episodes don't appear until Plex's next scheduled scan**: check the
  log for `requested Plex scan of downloaded video's folder` after a
  download. If you see `no Plex section contains the folder` instead,
  `YARRTUBE_PLEX_VIDEOS_PATH` doesn't match the folders your TV Shows
  library points at.
- **Category playlists don't show up**: see
  [Categories](CATEGORIES.md#in-plex).
- **`error sending request for url (http://.../library/sections)`** in the
  log: yarrtube can't reach Plex. Check that `YARRTUBE_PLEX_URL` isn't
  `localhost` (see [Configure yarrtube](#configure-yarrtube)) and that no
  firewall blocks port 32400.
