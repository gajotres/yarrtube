# Plex (TV Shows library)

## What you get

Every tracked playlist and channel shows up in Plex (and Kodi or Jellyfin)
as a **TV show**: one tile per playlist/channel, episode thumbnails,
Continue Watching, On Deck and "play next episode".

```

- **Channels** get one season per year, with episodes ordered by publish
  date.
- **Playlists** are a single season in playlist order. New videos are added
  at the end.

Episode numbers never change, so Plex keeps your watch progress.

Only step 1 is required. Step 2 is optional and makes new episodes show up
in Plex right after they download.

## 1. Set up a TV Shows library

Create a **TV Shows** library over the folders holding yarrtube's videos
(for example the host folders mounted at `/videos/playlists` and
`/videos/channels`), and in its _Advanced_ settings:

- **Scanner**: Plex TV Series.
- **Agent**: **Plex NFO Series**.
- **Seasons**: _Hide for single-season series_.
- **Use local assets**: on, for posters and thumbnails.

The Plex NFO agents need Plex Media Server 1.43.1 or newer. If **Plex NFO
Series** is missing from the agent list:

- Check the server version under _Settings → General_ and update if it's
  older than 1.43.1.
- After upgrading from a version without the NFO agents, restart Plex Media
  Server once more by hand.
- If it still isn't listed, open the server's own web app at
  `http://<YOUR_PLEX_IP>:32400/web` and create the library there. The
  hosted app at app.plex.tv may not list it yet, even after an upgrade.

Optionally enable _Settings → Library → Scan my library automatically_ and
_Run a partial scan when changes are detected_: Plex then imports new
episodes on its own, and the scan trigger below just makes it immediate.

## 2. Scan trigger (optional)

With the scan trigger on, yarrtube asks Plex to scan a show as soon as one
of its videos finishes downloading. You need:

- A Plex token (`X-Plex-Token`) to authenticate yarrtube's requests.
- The path at which the Plex server sees yarrtube's videos root.

### Get your Plex token (`YARRTUBE_PLEX_TOKEN`)

Follow Plex's official guide:
[Finding an authentication token / X-Plex-Token](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/).

Short version: in the Plex web app, open any library item → `⋯` →
_Get Info_ → _View XML_, and copy the `X-Plex-Token=...` value from the
opened page's URL.

If you can't find _View XML_, or you have a shell on the Plex server, you
can read the token from its `Preferences.xml` instead. On a Linux package
install:

```bash
sudo grep -o 'PlexOnlineToken="[^"]*"' \
  "/var/lib/plexmediaserver/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Preferences.xml"
```

The value between the quotes is the token. Treat it like a password: it
gives full access to your Plex account and server.

### Configure yarrtube

Set the environment variables on the yarrtube container and restart it:

```yaml
environment:
  - YARRTUBE_PLEX_URL=http://<YOUR_PLEX_IP>:32400
  - YARRTUBE_PLEX_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>
  # the path at which Plex sees yarrtube's videos root, i.e. the host side
  # of the /videos volume (e.g. /volume1/data/media/yarrtube):
  - YARRTUBE_PLEX_VIDEOS_PATH=<HOST_PATH_MOUNTED_AT_/videos>
```

All three are required: with only some of them set, yarrtube logs a
warning and never contacts Plex.

`localhost` inside the container is not your Docker host. If Plex runs on
the same machine, use its LAN IP (e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:32400`) or run
yarrtube with `network_mode: host` (then set `YARRTUBE_PORT` for the web
UI, since `ports:` is ignored).

## Troubleshooting

- **A playlist has no poster**: expected, only channels have one (their
  avatar).
- **Episodes show as "Episode 31502" without their title**: the library is
  not using the **Plex NFO Series** agent, or _Use local assets_ is off.
- **New episodes don't appear until Plex's next scheduled scan**: check the
  log for `requested Plex scan of downloaded video's folder` after a
  download. If you see `no Plex section contains the folder` instead,
  `YARRTUBE_PLEX_VIDEOS_PATH` doesn't match the folders your TV Shows
  library points at.
- **`error sending request for url (http://.../library/sections)`** in the
  log: yarrtube can't reach Plex. Check that `YARRTUBE_PLEX_URL` isn't
  `localhost` (see [Configure yarrtube](#configure-yarrtube)) and that no
  firewall blocks port 32400.
