# Installation and configuration

## Requirements

- Docker
- A YouTube Data API v3 key — create one for free in the
  [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/youtube.googleapis.com):
  create a project, enable the "YouTube Data API v3", then create an API key
  under **Credentials**.

## Run the container

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name yarrtube \
  -e YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /path/on/host/config:/config \
  -v /path/on/host/videos:/videos \
  ghcr.io/sergigp/yarrtube:latest
```

- `-v /path/on/host/videos:/videos` is where downloaded videos will show up
  on your host — point it at your media library.
- `-v /path/on/host/config:/config` holds yarrtube's state: the SQLite
  database (your tracked playlists and channels) and channel avatars. Always
  mount it — otherwise everything you've tracked is lost whenever the
  container is recreated, including on every [update](#updating).
- `PUID`/`PGID` are the numeric user/group ID the daemon runs as and that
  owns downloaded files — usually your own user's (`id -u` / `id -g` on the
  host). Leave them unset to run as root.

Then you can open `http://<YOUR_NAS_IP>:8080/` or `http://localhost:8080/`.

> [!WARNING]
> Yarrtube has no authentication: anyone who can reach the port can use the
> web UI and its API, including the folder browser. Keep it on your LAN, or
> put it behind a reverse proxy that handles authentication.

## Docker Compose

If you run a Docker Compose stack, add:

```yaml
services:
  yarrtube:
    container_name: yarrtube
    mem_limit: 256m
    image: ghcr.io/sergigp/yarrtube:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    environment:
      - YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your-youtube-data-api-v3-key
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/Madrid
    volumes:
      - /path/on/host/config:/config
      - /path/on/host/videos:/videos
```

## Configuration

Environment variables read by Yarrtube are listed below. Every variable except `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` is optional, so you only need to set the ones you want to override:

| `YARRTUBE_PLEX_VIDEOS_PATH`           | —                     | Where the Plex server sees yarrtube's videos root (`YARRTUBE_VIDEOS_PATH`), e.g. the host path `/volume1/data/media/yarrtube` mounted at `/videos`. Plex is asked to scan a show's folder after each download |

## Videos on disk

Each playlist and channel is saved as a TV show (layout in
[PLEX.md](PLEX.md#what-you-get)). Keep the videos root on a single
filesystem: downloads are staged in a hidden `.downloads` folder there and
moved into place when complete.

## Plex

Point a Plex **TV Shows** library (Plex NFO Series agent) at your videos
folders. Optionally, set `YARRTUBE_PLEX_URL`, `YARRTUBE_PLEX_TOKEN` and
`YARRTUBE_PLEX_VIDEOS_PATH` (all three) and yarrtube asks Plex to scan a
show's folder as soon as one of its videos is downloaded. The library setup
and the scan trigger are covered step by step in [PLEX.md](PLEX.md).

## Updating

> [!NOTE]
> Updating from 0.8.x or older? 0.9.0 moved the library to a TV show layout
> and changed the Plex settings. Follow
> [UPGRADING-TO-0.9.0.md](UPGRADING-TO-0.9.0.md) once instead.

docker stop yarrtube && docker rm yarrtube
# then re-run the `docker run` command above
```

With Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose pull yarrtube
docker compose up -d yarrtube
