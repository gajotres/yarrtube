# Building from source

Docker is the supported way to run Yarrtube (see
[INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md)). This guide is for building and running
the binary directly, e.g. to hack on it.

## Requirements

- Rust (stable, 1.85+; the crate uses edition 2024)
- Node.js 22 and npm, to build the web UI
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) on your `PATH`
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), which yt-dlp uses to merge audio and video
- [Deno](https://deno.com/), which yt-dlp uses to solve YouTube's player
  challenges. Without it some videos fail with "This video is not available"
- A YouTube Data API v3 key (see [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md#requirements))

## Build

The web UI is embedded into the binary at compile time, so build it first.
`cargo build` fails if `web/dist/` is missing:

```bash
(cd web && npm ci && npm run build)   # produces web/dist/
cargo build --release                 # produces target/release/yarrtube
```

## Run

```bash
cp .env.example .env    # then fill in YOUTUBE_API_KEY
scripts/run-local.sh
```

`run-local.sh` rebuilds the web UI, loads `.env`, points `YTDLP_PATH` at the
`yt-dlp` on your `PATH`, and starts `yarrtube serve` on
<http://localhost:8080>. The SQLite database (`yarrtube.sqlite3`) and
downloaded videos (`videos/`) live in the repo root, and both are gitignored.
Pass `--skip-web-build` to reuse the existing `web/dist/`, or `--help` for the
other options.

To run the binary yourself, set at least `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`, `YTDLP_PATH`
and `YARRTUBE_VIDEOS_PATH` (their defaults, `/app/bin/yt-dlp` and `/videos`,
only make sense in the Docker image) and run `target/release/yarrtube serve`.
All variables are listed in [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md#configuration);
that table shows the image's defaults, but outside Docker the database and
avatars default to `yarrtube.sqlite3` and `avatars/` in the working directory.

## Web UI

The UI in `web/` is a React + Vite single-page app written in TypeScript.
To iterate on it with hot reload, keep the backend running
(`scripts/run-local.sh --skip-web-build`) and start Vite's dev server, which
proxies `/api`, `/media` and `/avatars` to `localhost:8080`:

```bash
cd web
npm run dev          # dev server with hot reload
npm run test:watch   # Vitest suite, re-running on change
npm run check        # typecheck + lint + test, what CI runs
```

To try UI changes against a real library instead of an empty local one, point
the dev server at a running daemon, e.g. on a NAS. Only frontend changes show
up; backend changes need a daemon running an image that has them.

```bash
YARRTUBE_REMOTE_URL=http://192.168.1.142:8080 scripts/run-spa-against-remote.sh
```

It's read-only by default: the dev server answers every request but GET and
HEAD with 405, so actions like mark watched or delete fail instead of changing
the remote library. Pass `--allow-writes` to forward them. When node can't
reach the remote but curl can (macOS Local Network privacy blocks node from LAN
addresses until the terminal app is allowed under System Settings → Privacy &
Security → Local Network), the script bridges the proxy through curl by itself.

Layout of `web/src/`:

- `api/`: the HTTP layer. Response types mirroring the Rust DTOs
  (`types.ts`), fetch wrappers (`client.ts`) and react-query hooks
  (`queries.ts`).
- `lib/`: pure, unit-tested helpers (formatting, slugs, sidebar ordering,
  task descriptions).
- `hooks/`: React hooks (debouncing, the add-dialog lookup flow, video
  selection, watch-progress reporting).
- `components/`: the app's components; `components/ui/` holds the shadcn/ui
  primitives.
- `test/`: test setup and helpers. `mockApi` stubs `fetch` with a route
  table, `renderWithProviders` wraps a component in react-query and a memory
  router, and `aChannel`/`aVideo`/… build API fixtures.

Tests sit next to what they test (`foo.ts` / `foo.test.ts`) and run in jsdom
against the mocked API, so the suite finishes in seconds.

## Checks

One script runs every test suite, locally and in CI:

```bash
scripts/run-tests.sh                 # everything
scripts/run-tests.sh --only e2e      # one suite: web, rust, contract or e2e
scripts/run-tests.sh --ci            # what CI runs (also when CI=true)
scripts/run-tests.sh --workers 2     # end-to-end tests at once (default 3)
```

The suites are the web UI's checks, Rust formatting, clippy and tests, the
YouTube contract tests and the end-to-end suite (`e2e-tests/`, see its
README: the Docker image driven through real browsers against a fake
YouTube). CI runs all of them except the contract tests, which need the real
YouTube, on every pull request and push to `main`. The script only checks:
it installs and builds nothing, so install the web UI's and `e2e-tests/`'s
dependencies (and the Playwright browsers) and build the web UI first. Each
end-to-end worker runs its own container on its own ports, so the suite runs
in parallel and worktrees can run it at the same time. Before running
anything it checks every selected suite's dependencies, listing all that are
missing, and prints what will run: the suites, CI mode (`--ci` or
`CI=true`: no contract tests, failing end-to-end tests retried) and the
end-to-end workers and upgrade check. Each phase's output
goes to a log rather than the terminal: a progress line while it runs, its
time and test counts once done, and on failure only the failing tests with
their errors, plus the path of the kept logs.

### YouTube contract tests

The adapters that talk to YouTube (`yt-dlp` downloads, thumbnails,
captions, channel listings, and the Data API's playlists, videos, channels
and avatars) have tests against the real thing, in modules named
`youtube_contract_tests` next to each adapter. They're `#[ignore]`d, so
`cargo test` and CI skip them; run them with
`scripts/run-tests.sh --only contract`. It needs `yt-dlp` and `ffprobe` on `PATH` (or `YTDLP_PATH`), the network,
and `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` (from the environment or `.env`), and takes about ten
seconds. Run it after upgrading `yt-dlp` or when downloads start failing,
to tell a change on YouTube's side from a bug of ours. The fixtures (a short
Creative-Commons clip, Big Buck Bunny, the project's "test" playlist and an
inactive Creative-Commons channel) are listed with their credits in
`src/infrastructure/shared/youtube_contract.rs`.

## Deploy

This fork publishes images to `ghcr.io/gajotres/yarrtube`.
Every merge to `main` that passes CI, including the Docker end-to-end suite,
receives the next release tag and publishes `latest`, `X.Y.Z` and `X.Y` from
the same multi-architecture image. `scripts/next-release-tag.sh` increments the
last patch version unless `Cargo.toml` specifies a higher version. After image
publication succeeds, the workflow creates a GitHub release with generated notes.
The release tag and source commit metadata are stamped into the binary.

Manual Release workflow runs publish `edge` for testing a selected ref. SHA
image tags are not published. To roll back, pin an existing numbered release.
A manually pushed `vX.Y.Z` tag also triggers the stable release workflow.
