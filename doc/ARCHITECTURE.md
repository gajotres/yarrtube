# Architecture

Yarrtube is a single process (`yarrtube serve`) backed by one SQLite database.
Inside it, the HTTP API does only the synchronous part of each request: it
validates the input, saves state and publishes a **domain event**. Everything
slow or fallible (talking to YouTube, running `yt-dlp`, touching the
filesystem) happens later in the background in an event-driven fashion.

## Architecture Overview

    services -- "publish event" --> events
    services -- "schedule task" --> tasks

    events --> consumer -- "dispatch" --> subscribers
    consumer -. "5th failure" .-> events_dl
    tasks --> executor -- "dispatch" --> handlers
    executor -. "5th failure" .-> tasks_dl

    subscribers -- "call service /<br/>schedule task" --> services
    handlers -- "call service" --> services
```

For more information on the architectural decisions and conventions used in Yarrtube you can take a look at the [Rust Architect skill](../.claude/skills/rust-architect/SKILL.md).

## Example: track a channel and download its videos

To illustrate this domain-driven flow we can take a look at what happens when a user adds a channel subscription and all the videos end up downloaded:

1. `POST /api/channels` saves the channel and publishes `ChannelCreated` domain event.
2. The `ReconcileOnChannelCreated` subscriber runs asynchronously, polling the domain events table (which acts like a queue), and runs the first channel sync.
   - The sync writes the channel's show files (`tvshow.nfo`, and
     `poster.jpg` from its avatar), as every later sync does too.
   - The sync reads the channel's most recent uploads from YouTube using the YouTube API.
   - It saves each new video as `PENDING` and publishes one
     `VideoAddedToChannel` domain event per video.
   - It schedules the next `ReconcileChannel` task one reconcile interval
     later (`YARRTUBE_RECONCILE_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, default 1 hour).
3. For each `VideoAddedToChannel`, two asynchronous subscribers schedule a task each:
   - `FetchThumbnailOnVideoAddedToChannel` schedules a `FetchThumbnail`
     task.
   - `DownloadVideoOnVideoAddedToChannel` schedules a `DownloadVideo` task.
4. The `TaskExecutor` runs them. Both call `yt-dlp` inside the video's
   staging folder (`<videos root>/.downloads/<youtube id>`), take its
   episode number from the publish time `yt-dlp` reports, and move the
   result into the show's season folder (see below). The thumbnail usually
   arrives first, so the UI can show it while the video is still downloading.
   A finished download publishes `VideoDownloaded`, which asks Plex to scan
   the show folder when the scan trigger is configured.
5. Every hour, the `ReconcileChannel` task runs the sync again and schedules
   the next one. New uploads repeat steps 3–4. The sync also schedules a
   `FetchThumbnail` for any video still missing its thumbnail.

    Events->>Tasks: schedule FetchThumbnail + DownloadVideo per video
    Executor->>Tasks: poll and run tasks
    Executor->>YT: yt-dlp fetches thumbnail, then downloads video

    Note over Reconciler,Executor: One interval later, ReconcileChannel<br/>re-syncs and schedules the next run.
```

## Videos on disk

Each tracked playlist or channel is a TV show under its storage path:

```
<storage path>/
├── tvshow.nfo                                  ShowFileWriter, on every sync
├── poster.jpg                                  channels only (avatar copy)
└── Season <year>/                              Season 1/ for a playlist
    └── S<year>E<MMDDii> - <title>.{mp4,jpg,nfo}  S01E<nnn> - <title>.* for a playlist
```

- **Episode number** (`EpisodeNumber`, one of two value objects), assigned
  once, stored on the video and never recomputed, so files never rename:
  - `ChannelEpisodeNumber`: season = publish year, episode = publish month
    and day plus a two-digit index among the channel's videos published
    that day. Assigned in the database
    (`VideoRepository::assign_episode_number`, by whichever of the
    thumbnail fetch or the download needs it first).
  - `PlaylistEpisodeNumber`: season 1, episode = the playlist's next
    number (`Playlist::last_episode` + 1), assigned by
    `PlaylistVideoReconciler` when it first stores the video, in playlist
    position order. The counter guarantees a removed video's number is
    never reused. Migration `0008` numbered the videos of playlists
    tracked before this existed by their stored position.

  A stored season of `1` decodes as a playlist number.
- **Staging**: `yt-dlp` writes into `.downloads/<youtube id>`; the NFO is
  written at its final path first, then media and thumbnail are renamed
  into the season folder, so players never see a partial file.
- **Reconcile** sweeps orphans by path: show files, season folders and
  every file under a numbered video's base name are protected.
- **Legacy layout**: a recorded filename not under `Season ` is a per-video
  folder from older versions. It keeps being served; `VideoRelocator`
  moves it into the TV layout, either from the `migrate-layout`
  subcommand (`LayoutMigrator`, with a `--dry-run` that plans numbers
  without writing them) or from reconcile once the video's metadata can be
  fetched.

## Testing

Several layers, from fast/isolated to slow/real:

- **Rust unit tests** — inline `mod tests` in domain value objects and
  entities (`src/domain/**`). Pure logic: parsing/validation, state
  transitions, invariants. No I/O.
- **Rust behavior tests** — inline `mod tests` in HTTP handlers,
  subscribers, tasks and services. Exercise the real wiring (service +
  real SQLite repos via `Connection::open_in_memory()`) with `Fake*`
  doubles only at the external boundaries (YouTube API, yt-dlp,
  filesystem). Assert the full outcome: response, persisted state, and
  events/tasks produced.
- **Rust repository tests** — inline `mod tests` in the SQLite repos,
  run against in-memory SQLite with migrations applied. Verify queries,
  mapping and persistence.
- **Web tests** (`web/`, Vitest + jsdom + Testing Library) — unit tests
  for pure logic in `src/lib/` and hooks, and component tests that render
  through the real `QueryClient`/router with only `fetch` mocked. Assert
  user-visible behavior.
- **Smoke tests** (`smoke-tests/`, Playwright) — end-to-end against the
  real Docker image, hitting the real YouTube API and downloading a real
  video with `yt-dlp`. No doubles. Covers the full create → download →
  playback flow; run manually (locally or via the `workflow_dispatch`
  workflow), not on every PR.
